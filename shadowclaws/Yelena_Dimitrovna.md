Yelena 'Melodie des Eisens' Dimitrovna is a Blood Talon Ithaeur of the
[Litanei der Straßen](Litanei_der_Straßen "wikilink"). She is the only
one of the [Bear Hunters](Bear_Hunters "wikilink") known to the pack
that resides within the city, making her the natural contact for
[Grigor](Grigor "wikilink") in his quest to be invited to the lodge. So
far, she has not proven very favourable.

Yelena could probably work as a fashion model with her looks, if she
were to lose a few pounds of muscles. However, she seems to have no
ambitions of this kind, instead spending her time ceaselessly working
towards the pack's goals. Like the rest of her pack, she appears to have
drawn the short straw were humour is concerned -- it is a rare sight to
see her smile. Usually, her face is one of stern concentration -- or
disapproval. She wears leather clothing adorned with symbols that would
probably mean something to a member of the Bear Hunters. She usually
carries a spear into battle, very likely some sort of fetish.
