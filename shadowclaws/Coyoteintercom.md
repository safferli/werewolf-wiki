Some time ago, in some very different place, there was a pack of Uratha
that had a coyote as its totem. One of the benefits for that pack was
that the totem allowed the pack members to communicate with each other
over some distances, and the Uratha sometimes referred to this as Coyote
Intercom.

Some beings believe that traces of [Coyote
Intercom](https://hanners.pintsize.de/muclogs/coyoteintercom@conference.pintsize.de/)
might still linger in the spirit world and that it could be used by
revealing the exact phrase "Wissendes Auge der Nacht" to the spirit who
is guarding that place.
