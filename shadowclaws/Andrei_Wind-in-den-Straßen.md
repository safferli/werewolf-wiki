Andrej Lyokhovich, an Iron Master Ithaeur and alpha of the
[Glasfelle](Glasfelle "wikilink"). Acts as a ritual master to
[Angus](Angus "wikilink") and occasionally helps out with a spiritual
matter -- for a price, of course.

He is the 'leader' of the [Shepherds](Shepherds "wikilink"), and knows
more than probably anyone about the social structures of St. Petersburg.
He is extremly calm - almost unnaturally so, for a werewolf.
