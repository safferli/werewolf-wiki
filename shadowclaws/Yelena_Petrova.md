Iron Master Ithaeur of the pack [Schatten der
Zaren](Schatten_der_Zaren "wikilink"). Shadowname: Shadowtongue. Angus
calls her "Partygirl1986", but not to her face (or
[Aleksandr](Aleksandr "wikilink")'s).

Yelena is a very lively young woman, often found out partying. She has
made clear on several occasions that she considers the Oath of the Moon
to be 'a bit out-dated and old-fashioned'. Her facebook site has no less
than 529 friends, tendency rising.

It seems Yelena has somewhat missed her call as a Ritemaster and Mystic,
but her pack trusts her - when faced with a question about her
suitability, the answer always is 'Don't judge a book by its cover'.
