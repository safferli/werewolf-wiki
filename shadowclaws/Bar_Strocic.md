A bar run by the mafia in the [territory](territory "wikilink") of the
pack. Before [Grigor](Grigor "wikilink") rose in the ranks of the mafia,
he was a bouncer here. There is a back room and a basement where not
even Grigor had access to. Regularly, limousines would bring men to the
bar, who would enter the back room(s). Due to the very unpleasant spirit
landscape at this bar, speculation runs wild as to just what terrible
things might be taking place in the basement. Child prostitution?
Torture? Human trafficking? Trade in some horrible drugs?

The wild speculations as to the nature of the 'business' conducted here
were [recently](The_fate_of_The_Bleeding_Stone "wikilink") given new
fuel, when the pack discovered a distinct tatoo on the body of a ridden
that had created no end of trouble for them. Grigor instantly recognised
it: It grants free access to Bar Strocic.

The discovery of such a mark of entry on the body of a ridden lawyer,
well-established in the city, and associated with criminal elements and
violent spirits, is shocking in itself, but there is something even
worse: The pack easily recalls that the Mafia backed away from Grigor
and refused to help when it became clear he was at odds with The Lawyer.
If even the Mafia doesn't want to anger whatever was behind the agency,
it probably isn't a wise idea.

Or, more precisely, wasn't.
