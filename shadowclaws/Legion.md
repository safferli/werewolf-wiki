Legion is a [spirit court](Spirits "wikilink") consisting of insects,
invertebrae and associated concepts. It is easily overseen and likely
not very powerful. Spirits of insects that work in groups or swarms can
sometimes be found - they consist of hundreds of animals and move with a
characteristic noise. For solitary insects, only rumours exist.

The pack has met one cockroach spirit during the events at [Petersburg
Wilhelmplatz](Petersburg_Wilhelmplatz "wikilink"), but had no other
contact with the court so far.
