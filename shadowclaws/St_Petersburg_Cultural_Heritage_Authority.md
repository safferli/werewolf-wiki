A branch of the city administration, concerned with preservation of the
many historical buildings in the city - and making money out of them via
tourism. The branch is chronically short on cash, but since this is true
for almost any branch of the city administration (safe the Vodka-related
ones, probably), it seems to function quite well.

The branch also oversees restauration work on old buildings, a
never-ending task in a historically important site as St Petersburg.
[Grigori](Grigori "wikilink") joined the branch some time after his
return. He currently works as a conservator, and as a supervisor to the
underpaid workers the branch enlists for its projects. The offices of
the branch are located in the city center, in a very new building on
Nevsky project. The lower floor is public accesible, and serves as a
tourist information. Every member is required to spend a few hours here
each week, though no one likes to, and these hours are commonly traded
among the clerks as a sort of currency.

Currently, the branch is hopelessly overstrained by the extension of the
city's [subway system](St_Petersburg_Underground "wikilink"),
undertaking statical measurements on the cellars of the old buildings
and trying to locate spots where a caved-in structure might have
previously stood - an almost impossible task due to the lack of archives
from the pre-soviet era.
