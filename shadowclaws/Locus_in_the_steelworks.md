There is a (possibly quite powerful) locus in the steelworks that form
the western part of the pack's territory. It is claimed by the [court of
fire and steel](Spirits_of_Fire_and_Steel "wikilink"), as is the
[Heimeligkeitsfenster](Heimeligkeitsfenster "wikilink"). The pack knows
almost nothing about the window, and the spirits have made it clear that
any unannounced intrusions into their territory will be met with lethal
force.
