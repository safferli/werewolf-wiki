It seems there is a court of spirits of Jaggling Rank, meeting at the
[Palace Square](Palace_Square "wikilink") on nights where the moon is
split. This court can issue decisions on its members, known as a trial
by peers. The spirits seem to adhere by this decisions.

Werewolves - those that are of Jaggling rank - avoid the court. This is
due to the fact that any participator is deemed a member, and therefore
also subject to rulings of the court. No sane Forsaken wants to submit
himself to the rulings of a bunch of Jagglings.

The [pack](Shadowclaws "wikilink")
[once](The_fate_of_The_Bleeding_Stone "wikilink") persuaded a number of
members of the court to jugde a [spirit](The_Bleeding_Stone "wikilink")
for them. None of them has been to the court, and none has the rank
required.
