A spirit whose help was enlisted to fight against the [Great Slimy
One](Great_Slimy_One "wikilink"). Has since this fight risen to Jaggling
rank.

The spirit was part of the "Geschaffenen" or possibly "Best√§ndigen"
court, and quite Independent. It has changed allegiance to the [Steel
Predators](Steel_Predators "wikilink") during the events sorrounding
[the fate of The Bleeding
Stone](the_fate_of_The_Bleeding_Stone "wikilink"), allowing it to escape
a deal with the [Court of Eternal
Grace](Court_of_Eternal_Grace "wikilink") which bound it to servitude.

It is now bound to a sewage cleaning vehicle employed by the [St
Petersburg Sewage and Waste
Authority](St_Petersburg_Sewage_and_Waste_Authority "wikilink"). It
preys on anything smaller than itself in the Sewers, and claims them as
its hunting ground, actively resisting other Steel Predators that would
try to occupy it.
