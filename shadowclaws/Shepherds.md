*"Your herd is your territory. Your territory is your herd. As a
shepherd you watch over them, known, but not recognized."*

The [lodge](lodge "wikilink") of Shepherds is one of the Iron Master
Lodges that are present in the area of St. Petersburg. Its members are
spread all over Europe and Russia. The emphasis of the lodge of
Shepherds is understanding the humans in your territory -- what drives
them, what do they fear, what do they long for? As humans are the most
prominent source of essence, a deep understanding of the human part of
your territory can make managing the Hisil a lot easier.

It is known that the Shepherds possess some rituals and fetishes that
help them stay in touch with their herd. No precise details are known
outside the lodge, though. The Shepherds also seem to value social
skills highly and have little problem learning them from each other.

The Shepherds [take
in](Lodge_Initiations#Edouard's_Lodge_Initiation "wikilink") any Iron
Masters that turn up. Initiates gain a mentor, often
[Andrej](Andrei_Wind-in-den-Stra√üen "wikilink") himself, represented by
the merit Mentor 1. They are then told to show they can understand
humanity, and that they need not make too much of an effort - the lodge
will know when they are ready.

After working his way into the social elite and gaining access to the
sponsors of Neighbours for Neighbours, Edouard was
[accepted](Charity_Dinner "wikilink") into the lodge by his mentor
[Vanka Iosiforna](Vanka_Iosiforna "wikilink").
