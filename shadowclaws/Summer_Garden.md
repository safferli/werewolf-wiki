The [Summer Garden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Garden) is a
park in the east of central Petersburg. As the name kind of implies, it
is part of the Summer Residence of the Tsar. Right now, it is on the far
end of the no man's land to the west of the pack's territory.

It is known for its beautiful romantic scenery, and often visited by
young couples in love, or those who hope to become such. It is
surrounded by an artfully worked iron fence. The park has been restored
to its old beauty in the second half of the seventeenth century, after
much of it had been destroyed in a flooding. Still, many people claim
that the older park was even more beautiful - although there is
certainly no-one alive who has seen it with his own eyes, as the park
was destroyed.

The park has a certain air that is very calming, and there is a local
legend that if you entrust the name of a person you truly love to the
wind in the park on a rainy night, you will be given the key to her
heart. The park is locked at dusk, but police usually turns a blind eye
to those who climb the fence on rainy nights.

The [main gate](Summer_Gates "wikilink") to the park appears to be a
[locus](:Category:_Locus "wikilink") of yet undetermined attunement. The
spirit world still shows the park in the night of the flooding more than
200 years ago.
