Shuro is a wiry figure of slightly taller than average build. He usually
dresses in very plain clothes, perfect for blending into the crowds of
St. Petersburg. He is rumoured to be quite a fighter, and it is true
that he can move with extreme grace if he chooses so. Little else is
known about him.

Shuro made his first appearance to the pack in the meeting of all
werewolves belonging to the [alliance](alliance "wikilink"), where he
did not speak all evening. It was clear to most that he watched with
quite some interest, though.

He was later crucial in resolving the problems that occurred during [the
old werewolf's last play](the_old_werewolf's_last_play "wikilink"), but
he demanded a price for his help the extent of which has yet to be seen:
The [Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink") now have to advance their
borders into the no-man's-land between the two packs to fulfill their
part of the deal, narrowing the hiding place for rogue spirits and other
unpleasant things.

Shuro is of Japanese ancestry, though how far this reaches back is
unknown. He helped Angus [smelt](Claidheamh_m√≤r "wikilink") the iron for
his sword with an ancient technique.

Shuro has some secret that he is willing to kill for - a fact that
[Taras Mihailov](Taras_Mihailov "wikilink") found out the hard way.
