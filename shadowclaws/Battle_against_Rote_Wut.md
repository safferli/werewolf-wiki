The Battle against [Rote Wut](Rote_Wut "wikilink") was only a real
battle for the last few days of the conflict. Before that, members of
[Rote Wut](Rote_Wut "wikilink") -- especially '[Die
Amazone](Die_Amazone "wikilink")' -- infiltrated the southern part of
the packs territory and stirred conflict among the restless youth. They
also tried to turn some spirit courts against the werewolves. However,
they only succeeded with that part because [Grigor](Grigor "wikilink")
antagonized the [Spirits of Order](Spirits_of_Order "wikilink") by
killing some local law enforcement officers ((something along those
lines at last - don't remember exactly)). The [Rote
Wut](Rote_Wut "wikilink") was also responsible for setting up the waste
disposal, which resulted in the [battle](Fight_in_the_sewers "wikilink")
against the [Great Slimy One](Great_Slimy_One "wikilink").

When [Edouard](Edouard_Lambert "wikilink") arrived, things went
downward. [Grigor](Grigor "wikilink") killed the alpha of [Rote
Wut](Rote_Wut "wikilink"), 'Stahlknochen', in a disagreement on their
border, and 'Rote Wut' tried to hunt down the freshly changed Cahalith
on their ground. The Canadian businessman made it back to his hotel,
where 'Klauenwind' and the [Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink") arrived
at about the same time. In the resulting chase,
[Angus](Angus "wikilink") was severely injured by the Ghost Wolf Rahu,
but [Edouard](Edouard_Lambert "wikilink") got away. After some
convincing, he joined the pack that came to his rescue. When they were
confronted by 'Die Amazone', who almost killed Edouard, they managed to
convince her she was fighting for the wrong side -- following wrong
visions, tainted by Rabid Wolf. That turned the tide of battle, and with
inside information they were able to kill the Pure werewolf in their
territory, pacify the hostile spirit court and finally put an end to a
police investigation running since quite some time. Even the fighting
amongst the youth seemed to go back.
