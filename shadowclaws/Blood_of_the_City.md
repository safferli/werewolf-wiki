A powerful [spirit court](spirits "wikilink") concerned with everything
that keeps a city "running" - trade, traffic, electricity ... the list
is long, and many spirits belong to this court. The court is not young,
probably reaching back to the first cities, but it has changed a lot
over time and certainly grown more powerful in the modern world, where
cities have surged in importance.

Blood of the City has very weird internal rules and structures. It seems
the court is organised in "boards" (which might mean brood or not), who
cover certain areas of activity. There also exists some strange feudal
structure, perhaps a relict of older days, that is based on the transfer
of essence: Paying essence to a spirit makes him your liege. A liege is
supposed to speak on all matters that concern his vassals, but this
vassals may still speak on matters that concern others, for example
their own vassals. It is not unheard of for circles of allegiance to
form (A is lord of B is lord of C is lord of A). All this, and the fact
that Blood of the City can be quite unified if there is a threat, makes
the court difficult and trying to deal with.

[The Director](The_Director "wikilink") is a Jaggling member the players
have dealt with.
