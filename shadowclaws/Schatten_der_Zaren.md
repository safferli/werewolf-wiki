"Schatten der Zaren" is a pack of werewolves living to the north of the
[Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink"). Their territory is centred on the
[Peter and Paul
fortress.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Paul_fortress) Some
members of the pack are among the oldest werewolves in the city. The
pack is also the centre of the loose [alliance](alliance "wikilink") of
werewolves in St. Petersburg, as the 'High Judge' is their alpha.

"Schatten der Zaren" claims the largest Forsaken territory in the City,
extending a good part to the north and west of their stronghold. As a
blessed pack, with many members of high renown rank, and due to their
leader being High Judge, they are somewhat the "alpha pack of packs",
though they never make their leading role explicit so as not to stir up
trouble. They keep to themselves, but are willing to offer advice if
sought out on proper terms.

They often used to function as mentors for the young werewolves of the
Shadowclaws, but this has largely ceased since the Shadowclaws have
started expanding their territory and showing that they can stand on
their own feet (and claws).

The [totem](Window-to-the-West "wikilink") of "Schatten der Zaren" is
rumoured to be an old spirit of learning, though little is known about
it. The pack is highly protetive of their totem and its identity.
