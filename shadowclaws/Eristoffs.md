The Eristoffs are an old family of Wolfblooded in
[Petersburg](Petersburg "wikilink"). Their origin is not currently
known, but they seem to have served the Ivory Claws as breeding
material, producing Pure with a 'clean' heritage. The family was very
strictly organised and quite loyal to the Pure, if only out of fear of
retaliation. It was known in the area that one shouldn't ask too many
questions about them - several people had disappeared.

Apparently, when Petersburg was
[conquered](The_Legend_of_the_Lodge_of_Enlightened "wikilink") by the
Forsaken, the Pure told the family to keep its heads down, as they would
be back soon. Amazingly, the threat of the Pure returning (and, perhaps,
the advantages of a strictly-run family business) where enough to keep
the family a secret for almost a decade.

When the [Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink")
[recently](Breeding_Grounds "wikilink") stumbled upon the Eristoffs, the
Ivory Claws were alarmed by the threat to the 'pure blood' of the
family, and attacked. The attack was beaten back with losses on both
[sides](Die_Amazone "wikilink"), though the Pure managed to abduct three
of five branches of the family.

They then settled on destroying the rest, leaking all information about
the business and its illegal practices to the police. This lead to the
arrest of Ioann, a family head. With the help of
[Edouard](Edouard "wikilink"), he managed to convince the court that he
alone was responsible, avoiding further arrests in the family.

During the first change of [Ilya Eristoff](Ilya_Eristoff "wikilink"),
the pack finally managed to convince Ilpati, the last remaining head,
that the Ivory Claws where no longer in power, and that the so-called
'traitors' were actually more benevolent. It has to be seen how the fate
of the family will develop in the future.
