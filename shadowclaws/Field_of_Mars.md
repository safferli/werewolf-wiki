The [Field of
Mars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_Mars_\(Saint_Petersburg\))
is a large public square in the east of central Petersburg. It is
located right next to the [Summer Garden](Summer_Garden "wikilink"). The
correct name is actually 'victims of the revolution square', though
noone uses it.

There is an eternal flame in the center of the large place, as a
reminder of the victims of the 1917 revolution. There is also a number
of statues of russia's greatest generals. The field had many uses during
the history of the city, the longest (and name-giving) being a military
parade ground from the end of 18th to early 20th century.

The spirit world of the place looks almost like an arena, the ground
strewn with sand, large braziers burning in the corners. As the pack
could [experience](The_fate_of_The_Bleeding_Stone "wikilink")
first-hand, a number of warlike spirits live here, taking the form of
ancient warrior statues. They are most likely linked to Mars and the
concept of a warrior, though little is known.
