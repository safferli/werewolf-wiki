Fleshmade is a [spirit court](Spirits "wikilink") nominally encompassing
all items made by mankind. Since the court is quite new (it emerged
during the final phases of industrialisation with the advent of mass
production), this claim is quite far from reality: Everything that
already existed belonged to other courts (mainly [Blood of the
City](Blood_of_the_City "wikilink") and [Court of Eternal
Grace](Court_of_Eternal_Grace "wikilink")). Thus the court started in a
niche, encompassing the "soulless" mass-produced items. These have
become very common, though, and so the Court has grown in power and
seems to be among the top players today. It is still easy not to notice
it, though.

Today, the spirits of the court usually belong to items that are
considered to lack 'identity' (everything humans usually don't have a
personal connection to), and associated conceptual spirits. Due to its
(relatively) fast rise to power and conflicting claims, the court has
many enemies, especially among the more powerful courts.

The pack has found the spirit of the pharmacy at
[Wilhelmplatz](Wilhelmplatz "wikilink") hiding as a Ridden. They gave it
to [Blood of the City](Blood_of_the_City "wikilink") to gain favour with
the court.
