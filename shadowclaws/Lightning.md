*"Unseen, yet always present - as the electricity running through this
city. Electricity is what defines the modern world, the one we live in.
It can keep you warm at night, or it can strike you down as a
thunderbolt from an unseen direction."*

The [lodge](lodge "wikilink") of Lightning is a community of Iron
Masters all around the world, who dedicate themselves to understanding
the impact modern technology has made on the lives of the werewolves and
the duty of the Forsaken. For a long time, technological progress was
slow to non-existent, but in the last two centuries almost everything
has changed. This does not only affect the lives of humans - it also has
vast consequences for the spirit world, especially in the cities of the
modern world. Understanding these consequences is of the utmost
importance if one wants to keep the inhabitants of a city's Hisil on
their side of the gauntlet.

Werewolves of the lodge of Lightning have a good understanding of modern
technology, and are known to teach those skills among themselves. They
are rumoured to possess gifts from spirits most other werewolves haven't
even heard about yet.

[Aleksandr](Aleksandr "wikilink") has applied for the lodge, leading to
a very uncommon [night out](Disco_Fever "wikilink").
