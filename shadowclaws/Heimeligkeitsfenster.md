A locus of Hearth and Homeliness, in [Angus](Angus "wikilink")'s living
area. Situated in a ruined building, hobos meet and can warm themselves
at a small fireplace, which is also the locus. The pack has secured
right of passage for this locus, but anything going beyond this will
ensure the wrath of the [Spirits of Fire and
Steel](Spirits_of_Fire_and_Steel "wikilink").
