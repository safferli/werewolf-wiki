Two very weird [spirits](spirits "wikilink") that are reflections of a
riot at [Wilhelmplatz](Wilhelmplatz "wikilink") some 150 years ago. They
appear in the weeks preceding the anniversary of the riot and start
recruiting local spirits to their cause. How exactly this recruitment
works is unclear, but it is on a subconscious basis and even affects
werewolves. Recruits feel a strong urge to fight for their master, and
are usually motivated by a promise of essence and feeding opportunities.
The two parties clash on the date at Wilhelmplatz, were many spirits are
discorporated and the area is drained of essence. This has led to the
formation of a Barren.

The followers of Son and Nephew consist entirely of Gafflings - it is
unclear if this is due to the fact that Jagglings can feel the influence
and leave the area beforehand or if they are immune. Still, the entire
area is split among their followers and the widespread destruction will
not spare anyone who declares no allegiance to either.

Following [recent events](Petersburg_Wilhelmplatz "wikilink"), the
combat between the two spirits has been ritualised, the pack providing a
combatant and the price (a greater Gaffling). As such, the growth of the
Barren has been stopped, yet there is still a spiritual wasteland that
will take much effort to remove ... and it remains to be seen what
becomes of the two spirits.
