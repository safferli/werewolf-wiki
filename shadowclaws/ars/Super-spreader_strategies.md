My [initial plans](On_procreation "wikilink") are now set in motion. I
have talked with [Albrecht](Albrecht "wikilink") and he has
(reluctantly, and only after considerable pressure) set up a "Children's
Fund" for the prospective mothers. He said that it might not be such a
terrible bad idea after all, as we currently have a predominantly male
group of covenfolk. Some women to do the traditional woman's work will
help the covenant finances, he said. No matter, what do I care?

Now to the prospective mothers. I have been searching the general
vicinity of our covenant for suitably pretty, spiritual, and charming
young ladies. With some persuasion (tricking the gullible, bribing the
aspiring, impressing the docile, and magically inducing the stubborn) I
have succeeded in my strategy. In fact, I must say that this task was
entirely enjoyable, and I quite fell for my "girls"\!

## Alwine, the gullible

## Friederike, the docile

## Hedwig, the stubborn

## Ulrike, the aspiring
