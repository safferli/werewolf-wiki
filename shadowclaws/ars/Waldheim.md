Waldheim, which has a Magic aura of 2, is a tiny and isolated hamlet in
the Westerwald, a large forest to the east of the Rhine valley. It can
be reached in half a day's travel along forest paths from the village of
Ems (which is on the River Lahn, about 5 miles upstream from the Rhine).

In the centre of the small clearing is an ancient oak tree, now
partially enclosed by [Aphanius](Aphanius "wikilink")' large pentagonal
edifice, which completely dominates the place. It is surrounded by a
half-dozen huts, some ancient stone foundations, and the forest. A small
stream runs by one side. The largest hut belongs to the hamlet "elder",
[Ludold](Ludold "wikilink"), who is a gaunt middle-aged man with spiky
white hair and has a habit of wearing odd things. Another hut belongs to
his son, [Torven](Torven "wikilink"), a rugged young man dressed in
leathers with a she-wolf companion, Red-Hame. In one set of the stone
foundations dwell some seemingly tame(ish) wild pigs. In the other is a
vegetable plot. They also have a bee tree. The hamlet has very little
contact with the outside world, although they trade what surplus they
have (e.g. pigs, honey) for grain, which is kept in a small barn. The
various animals in the clearing don't seem particularly bothered by each
other.

The covenant's grogs that live here dwell in a small barracks along the
path just beyond the clearing. [Relentus](Relentus "wikilink")' large
lab is hidden a couple of dozen paces behind the clearing.
