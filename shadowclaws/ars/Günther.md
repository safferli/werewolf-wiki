Günther is the personal shield grog of [Aphanius](Aphanius "wikilink").
Trained in [Fengheld](Fengheld "wikilink"), he accompanies the young
magus since he left the covenant. Günther is not the brightest of
fellows, but that rarely matters - Aphanius only demands unquestioning
obedience and loyalty. Günther has proven himself a capable swordsman,
but is frequently overstrained with the protection of his master, who is
prone to exposing himself to dangers. This has already resulted in
Aphanius suffering a number of serious wounds, though he has never
blamed Günther for this.

Günther is now stationed in Waldheim, where he stands guard at the door
to Aphanius' laboratory (and living) building, keeping out non-hermetic
visitors and emphasising his masters claim of authority over the
village.
