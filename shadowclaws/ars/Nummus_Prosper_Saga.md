An Ars Magica saga set in the [Rhine
Tribunal](Rhine_Tribunal "wikilink").

The covenant of Nummus Prosper, officially formed in 1221 AD, has its
main site on [Pfalz Island](Pfalz_Island "wikilink"), on the River
Rhine. There is a [chapter house](Waldheim "wikilink") in the Westerwald
Forest. The name of the covenant means "lucky coin", a reference to the
profitable toll-gathering business and to the [lucky fairy
gamble](Court_of_Dark_Summer "wikilink") on the toss of a coin which
(indirectly) led to the covenant's founding.

Here is a [timeline](Nummus_Prosper_Timeline "wikilink") of events.

## House Rules

  - [Houserules](Ars_Houserules "wikilink"), who hasn't got 'em?
  - A handy [quick reference table](media:Table.pdf "wikilink") so one
    doesn't always have to browse the book when casting spontaneous
    spells (not really a house rule)
  - Another utility to quickly compute Lab Totals - just fill in your
    stats on the left and lab specialisations on the right to get all
    the totals. You need only fill in the yellow fields, the others are
    calculated automatically - Activity Specialisations are NOT included
    (since they don't apply all the time...)\!
    [Here](media:LabTotal.zip "wikilink") is a .zip that contains an
    .ods (can't upload .ods directly).
