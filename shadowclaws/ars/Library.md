## Comments on books

Christoph writes: Just write all changes on this page, and I'll make a
new pdf version for easier readability. Also, don't forget to write
comments\! Undine, your new books will henceforth be numbered, so no
need to bother inventing names for them ;o) I am *still* missing the
book comments from Relentus and Undine from VT4\!

Root of the Art Herbam: A very detailed and precise description of the
basic principles, yet of no value beyond the first study. Aphanius,

Copies of the Roots (they are Cr, In, Pe, Re, An, Co, He, Me, Vi) can be
gotten for 3 pawns each from the Redcaps. Where the Root of a desired
Art does not exist, you can obtain a good-quality beginning summa from
covenants that are willing to trade with you (currently, Fengheld,
Oculus Septentrionalis, and Triamore, possibly Waddenzee) for about 3 or
4 pawns each.

## Books on loan

  - The Root of Mentem (this will probably be returned soon...)
