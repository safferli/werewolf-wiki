With the procurement of my [Longevity
Ritual](On_the_perfect_Longevity_Ritual "wikilink") getting closer, I
need to think about the future. The Ritual will leave me sterile, so I
can no longer enrich the world with further Vexators. While I am not
particularly keen to settle down, I must admit that the thought of
living for hundreds of years without the opportunity to watch and
encourage my totally charming and pleasant offspring is depressing. I
believe I have read a Tractatus by some Bonisagus bloke, who called this
behaviour "articulus media vita". Anyway, I am an accomplished magus, so
I can make plans to prevent this. I will simply look in the general
vicinity of our Covenant for suitable mothers: fair, cute, active, and
smart girls of my age or younger. I can and will then use several
possible ways to father some children with these: Corpus or Mentem
magics, my natural charm, disguises, many possibilities. Once I then
have three to six children on their way, I can take my Longevity Ritual.
That leaves me two or three years to complete this task. Shouldn't be
too much of a problem. The mothers then can live at our covenant, where
a modest pension will be handed to them. I will talk to
[Albrecht](Albrecht "wikilink") and leave the specifics to him.
