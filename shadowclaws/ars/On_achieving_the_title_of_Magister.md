Due to the peculiarities of the Rhine Tribunal's Peripheral Code, a
master will always win over a journeyman in a dispute. This means, any
run-of-the-mill Ex Misc riff-raff master can claim the fruits of my own
labour and get away with it\! And there is absolutely nothing I could
do. This, of course, cannot do. I therefore wish to attain the rank of a
master as soon as convenient. No, definitely earlier than that.

To achieve the rank of a master, I need three other master of this
Tribunal. These will grant me a token, signalling that they would acept
me as a master in their midst. Once I have gathered three tokens, I may
claim the rank of master. [Aphanius](Aphanius "wikilink") keeps on
insisting that I also need to be known in the Tribunal for my magical
prowess. This may be a binding restriction for him, but surely not for
me. A man of my statue, a pillar in the scientific community will have
no problems to be recognised by his peers.

## Achieving master rank

These three masters granting the tokens may not be either of my House or
of my covenant and should be of different guilds. A sensible system,
designed to stop upstart Houses such as the Tremere. I have my eyes set
on three masters:

  - Henri de Tours. A Jerbiton master of the Apple guild. He is a
    likeable chap. We already are in letter contact and exchange
    business prospects, books and ideas. I think there will be no
    difficulty in obtaining his token.
  - A master of the Ash guild. I still have not decided whom to ask, but
    a Flambeau aggressive magus would probably be my best bet. I might
    be able to offer some Hoplite work as "payment" for the token. There
    should be a suitable aggressive Flambeau somewhere... I also have
    the bargaining chip of the Demon-warding item that we secured. I
    also wish to impress the Ash guild with my invention of the spell
    *It's raining men*.
  - A third master of either the Linden, or possibly the Oak guild.
    Occultes from Durenmar seemed friendly enough.

Additionally, I have trained a [familiar](On_his_familiar "wikilink"). I
was let to believe that this would make me look more competent and
deserving of a master title.
