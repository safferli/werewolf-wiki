[Aphanius](Aphanius "wikilink")' Talisman is a small tiara he usually
wears around his head. It is made of wood from the Rowan tree,
reinforced by two long bands of iron wrapped around the wood, crossing
each other numerous times (the iron thus gives a pattern like xxxxxx).
On the front the tiara carries the Symbol of House Tremere (a square
inscribed in the symbol of Mars).

The Talisman currently has a capacity of 7 pawns, 2 of which are taken
by the following effects:

  - Flight of Frau Holles Feathers

ReCo 18 (6 uses/day, Item maintains concentration)

The wearer can move slowly in any direction, not requiring support. If
he wishes to change his movement, he must concentrate, otherwise the
item maintains the effect. In fact, he appears to simply blow about as a
snowflake gripped by the wind - thus the name of the effect.

(Base 5, +1 Concentration, +1 Item maintains concentration, +3 6
uses/day)

It is attuned to grant Aphanius a +7 bonus on spells to harm or repel
fairies, due to its iron component.
