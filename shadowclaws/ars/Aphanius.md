#### The Character

A magus of House Tremere.

He obviously has a strange heritage: His skin does not reflect light as
well as it should. While it's simply a bit darker than usual in
daylight, it drops to almost utter black at night. While this appearance
might be unsettling, Aphanius has a very smooth voice that has a strange
but compelling sound. (His Faerie Blood grants +1 on rolls to influence
people). Observers skilled in Faerie Lore find it likely that his
heritage is that of nightly faeries, who whisper in the ears of sleepers
to compel them to actions - a rather dark breed of fae.

Aphanius wears the traditional robes of House Tremere - in his case,
they are coloured blue-black. He has not yet been spotted without them.
A longsword is usually strapped to his belt, and his long black hair is
well-kempt and usually held behind the head by a small tiara -
[Aphanius' Talisman](Aphanius'_Talisman "wikilink"). He wears a full
beard, which has regrown in recent years since it was vandalized by
Vexator at the Tribunal 1221.

Due to a Twilight Scar, ice does not melt on his person.
