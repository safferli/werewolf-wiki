See [here](Seasonal_activities "wikilink") (entries in bold) for all
covenant work performed.

According to the [charter](charter "wikilink"), you have to do one
season every two years. This means that by the end of 1226, each member
should have performed at least three seasons of covenant work. A
covenant meeting dropped one of the two-year requirements, so each
member needs to do 5 seasons of covenant work up until 1232. The actual
totals (at the end of 1231) are:

  - Aphanius: 5 seasons
  - Relentus: 5 seasons
  - Undine: 6 seasons
  - Vexator: 6 seasons

<!-- end list -->

  - *Balderic: 1 season*

**If anyone hasn't completed the "downtime tasks" by the next sessions,
we'll just assume he'll do covenant work all of the seasons without
grumbling\!**
