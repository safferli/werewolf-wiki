I need to make sure I have my [longevity
ritual](Longevity_Rituals "wikilink") ready by 1233. I only expect the
finest potion to be useful, as I do not wish to further bother my life
with the longevity ritual. Hard work once will save me a lot of trouble
in the years to come\! I have already made some [first
inquiries](Tribunal_of_1227#Longevity_Ritual "wikilink") at the [last
Tribunal](Tribunal_of_1227 "wikilink") and I believe two main contenders
remain for who is allowed the honour to craft my longevity ritual:
Epidauros in the far-away Theben Tribunal, and Sinews of Knowledge, in
the more nearby Greater Alps Tribunal.

## Epidauros

I shall write a letter to the covenant in the far Thebes Tribunal. They
are reputedly the very best the Order has to offer in terms of healing
and longevity rituals. I wonder what they charge, and if their
reputation is even justified?

After three or four seasons, a reply arrives. It is a strange-looking
and strange-smelling scroll; on the wax seal is the symbol of a snake
wrapped around a staff. The script is also unusual. The delivering
Redcap says that he has brought an accompanying Arcane Connection, which
one of his colleagues had to gather, and requests a pawn of vis for this
service.

Vexator replies positively:

(Note: [Vis](Vis "wikilink") is deducted. The 15 pawns for the
Enkoimeteria and the Blood of Medusa goes via Redcap, the 7 pawns for
the LR I'll take with me and deposit in person.)

## Sinews of Knowledge

Archmage Paxon of House Verditius is said to be the very best in terms
of longevity rituals, but being a Verditius, and an Archmage to boot,
his prices will surely be more than daylight robbery. I hear that even
other Archmagi cannot get his attention, and even this *entirely*
unbelievable rumour that he will not accept payment in Vis any more, as
he has too much of it\! A Verditius magus refusing Vis payments? Surely
that must be wrong. He'd be instantly cast out of his money-grubbing,
vis-hoarding, monopolistic thug-ridden House\!

To stay realistic, Archmaga Philomena offers probably only slightly less
perfect services for a (barely) affordable Vis cost. It is said that she
charges two rooks of Vis, 12 pawns of which have to be Techniques for
one season of her time to complete a longevity ritual. I shall write her
a letter, asking her if this is correct, and if she could spare me a
season of her time some time in 1232.

> <i> Salve achimaga Philomena, filia XXX of House Bonisagus(?)
> I hope I am not overstepping my boundaries in being so bold and
> claiming a few diameters of your precious research time. As an ageing

A reply arrives:
