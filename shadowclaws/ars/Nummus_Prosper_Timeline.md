each magus.

## 1220

  - Winter: The apprentices arrive at Durenmar and receive their gild
    training. [Aphanius](Aphanius "wikilink") completes his Gauntlet
    (certamen). Aphanius and [Vexator](Vexator "wikilink") are sent to
    recover a Jerbiton magus (Timotheus) lost on a hunt in the Black
    Forest; they are successful, of course. This was somehow part of
    Vexator's Gauntlet?
  - Spring: Swearing of the Oath at the spring equinox in the Forum of
    Hermes and official admittance into the Order of Hermes. Greeting by
    [Murion](Murion "wikilink"), the prima of House Bonisagus. The new
    magi, together with a certain [Relentus](Relentus "wikilink") from
    the Roman Tribunal, are sent to investigate the Rhine Gorge, which
    has been opened to Hermetic settlement after a number of covenants
    were destroyed in a series of unfortunate events (the latest
    involving the Archbishop of Cologne). They decide to establish a
    covenant there. However, they first spend a season writing books for
    the [Great Library](Great_Library "wikilink"). (Aphanius was too
    wounded to travel)
  - Summer: Arrival in the Rhine Gorge and investigation of possible
    covenant sites; decision to settle [Pfalz
    Island](Pfalz_Island "wikilink") and perhaps also the Westerwald;
    negotations with Baron Schönburg result in a <s>hostile takeover</s>
    [benign redistribution of property
    rights](Notes_on_the_measures_taken_to_remove_the_baron_of_Schönburg's_bastard_son_from_our_rightful_property "wikilink")
    of the island occupied by his bastard son. During the rescue of
    [Karlotte Schönburg](Karlotte_Schönburg "wikilink"), the [Court of
    Dark Summer](Court_of_Dark_Summer "wikilink") is discovered; the
    healing of Karlotte is effected by winning a coin toss against the
    Crone of the court. Reconstruction starts. Evil undead creatures
    attack the covenant from the adjacent island to the south, a
    possible heritage of the previous owner. Vis is discovered on the
    island, at the Schönburg, and in the Westerwald. Some toll-runners
    are thwarted.
  - Autumn: Visit to the wine festival at Baccharach; source of vis
    discovered; Vexator has a "bad trip".
