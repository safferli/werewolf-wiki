A fairy court in a regio in the Westerwald, not too far from
[Waldheim](Waldheim "wikilink"). It can be accessed during Winter, in
the daytime. Upon traversing a snowy clearing, the way is blocked by two
giant snowmen guardians. In order to pass, one must succeed at a
challenge, a test of Wisdom, Endurance, or the Hunt. (Possibly beating
the crap out of the snowmen would also work?) Beyond, a path leads up to
the hilltop at the centre of the regio. Here, snowflakes drift gently
around, and numerous fairy wolves and other lesser faeries may be found
in repose. The ruler of the court, the Maid of Frozen Dew, is seated in
a cave behind a pane of ice. She has the seeming of a beautiful maiden
with a serene expression, dressed in a pale gown and wearing a coronet
of ice.

The court appears to be seeking assistance in protecting the wolves from
the Count of Nassau's huntsmen. They do not appear to welcome those who
hunt in the forest, at least those who have not obtained permission.

In several ways, this court appears to be counterpart of the [Court of
Dark Summer](Court_of_Dark_Summer "wikilink").
