Shieldgrog of [Vexator](Vexator "wikilink"). She seems fairly proficient
with a bow.

Vexator is trying to turn her into a spy/diplomat, stressing individual
and independent thinking (this is in stark contrast to the demands
[Aphanius](Aphanius "wikilink") makes of [his
shieldgrog](GÃ¼nther "wikilink")), covert operations, and even ordering
her to learn to read and write. The other magi think this is folly, and
Jacqueline is often overwhelmed and at loss as to what is expected from
her.

Jacqueline is especially "fond" of [Aphanius](Aphanius "wikilink") since
his genius joke about her recently deceased colleague. (He was beheaded
by some beast, whereupon Aphanius remarked: "Yes, you have to be careful
with magic. It's very complex and you might well lose your head.")
