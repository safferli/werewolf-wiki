In the year 1221, when our [fine
covenant](Nummus_Prosper_Saga "wikilink") was founded, House Tremere has
tasked me with the following:

  - Investigate the fate of Tremere Magi at Trier.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    This I have done, and received a Vim Tractatus in Return.

<!-- end list -->

  - Report on local faerie courts, their influences and politics.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    I am still gathering information, but will likely have enough for a
    full report soon. I shall request a Lab Text for "Sight of Active
    Magics" with Sun Duration in return.

<!-- end list -->

  - Lead the covenant with wisdom to success.

<!-- end list -->

  -
    I am still working on this, and will likely be all my life. What is
    the purpose of such a generic task?

<!-- end list -->

  -
    [Aphanius](Aphanius "wikilink"), Filius Clemens, Filius Stentorius,
    Filius (irgendwann sollten wir mal die Namen hier beschlie√üen,
    Andrew), Filius Tremere of House Tremere
    Princeps of the Covenant of Nummus Prosper
    in the Chapter House of the Covenant of Nummus Prosper located at
    Waldheim
    in the Autumn of the Year 1230
