**Name?** 4 CrIg Items to give "Magical Superiour Lighting" to every
magus, created by Relentus. *(Details?)*

        Since Relentus is Volker's character, we're never going to see
        stats for it on the wiki. I think it was a Cr(Re)Ig effect,
        either 20 or 25.

**Helmet of the Hunter of Hermes** (InVi 24)

*T:Ind, R:Touch, D:Sun, constant effect*

A simple iron helmet with a leather strap to fix it on the chin. Its
wearer can see any item containing Vis shimmering with an inner light,
making raw Vis easy to identify. This effect has a penetration of 0.

*(Base 1, +4 Vision, +2 Sun, +1 Touch, +4 constant effect)*

This item is used by Emelric to find Vis in the Westerwald. He is
usually out for a few days before returning with any findings or hunted
game. Aphanius takes care to always have an arcane connection to the
Grog at hand in Waldheim.

**Hand of Poseidon**

A (Re Aq) device that may remotely prevent bigger ships to pass Pfalz
Island. Exact stats yet to be determined.
