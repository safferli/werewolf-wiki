The maiden is a greater Jaggling of pure beauty - a very rare breed of
spirit associated with truth, purity and beauty. Her mere presence seems
to have a strong impact on spirits of negative emotions, and it appears
she has Numina capable of freeing a werewolf from the grip of Kuruth.

Spirits of positive emotions or concepts are rather rare in the Hisil of
the World of Darkness, and usually have a slim chance of existing for
any prolonged period. There are just to many spirits of opposing
concepts that ruthlessly hunt and destroy them. Finding even a lesser
Jaggling from those ranks is no easy task, so she is probably the only
greater Jaggling of her choir in western (or even all of) russia.

The maiden belongs to the [court of Eternal
Grace](court_of_Eternal_Grace "wikilink") and is hidden in a complicated
web of pockets in the Hisil of the [Twin
Palaces](Twin_Palaces "wikilink"). It appears her combat capabilities
are rather weak for a greater Jaggling.

She was recently involved in a [play](reality_theatre "wikilink") staged
by [Prince Yaromir](Prince_Yaromir "wikilink"), another Jaggling of her
court, designed to bring [the Bleeding
Stone](the_Bleeding_Stone "wikilink") over to the court. Strangely
enough, [Angus](Angus "wikilink") learned that another name for her
might be [Eternal Grace](Eternal_Grace "wikilink"), a name that also
applies to [Prince Yaromir](Prince_Yaromir "wikilink").
