The Crimson Tears claim the former territory of [Rote
Wut](Rote_Wut "wikilink") to the south of the
[Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink"). They were founded by [Die
Amazone](Die_Amazone "wikilink"), the last member of the Rote Wut. They
favour a different approach though: Where Rote Wut was known for its
brutality and rejection of the [alliance](alliance "wikilink"), the
Crimson Tears are a part of it and seem to be more open to dialogue.

The Shadowclaws have a favour remaining from [die
Amazone](die_Amazone "wikilink") for letting the pack use their locus.
They also helped out in a fight once, so relations seem to be quite
good. In a [recent](Breeding_Grounds "wikilink") attack by the Pure, die
Amazone was killed. Speaks-for-the-dead has taken the favour she owed
the Shadowclaws.

Since then, Boneblade has taken the Role of Alpha, and the pack has
again taken a more rejective stance towards the
[alliance](alliance "wikilink"), not showing up on any meetings except
for the [obituary](In_memory_of_Amazone "wikilink") of its former alpha.
Still, they have not formally declared that they leave the alliance. The
pack's leadership seems to rest mostly on Sergei and Arja, and both are
not very open for dialogue with werewolves outside the pack. The Crimson
Tears have made it clear they will kill trespassers, but unlike Rote Wut
have also stated they will stick to their territory - and they seem to
have observed this.

The totem of the [Crimson Tears](Crimson_Tears "wikilink") is said to be
the spirit of a certain building in their territory, where the pack
regularly meets. Rumour says its a bar (with illegal fights in the
basement), but this is not confirmed and so far noone wanted to draw
their anger by investigating matters of the pack.
