A very noble club in the east of the packs territory. It opens around 22
pm, when the law requires all clubs in the area to close. They seem to
have protection within the [city
administration](St_Petersburg_City_Administration "wikilink"), as there
is never any reaction to the frequent complaints by residents.

The club has three floors, and admittance is strictly monitored -
without expensive designer-clothes, the only possibility to get in seems
to be accompanying one of the regulars. With less than resources 3, one
cannot afford to go here - and even then its more a 'once in a month'
thing.

The club is infamous not only for the noise that disturbs the local
population, but also for the tendency of people to disappear around its
premises. This is attributed to young girls (and occasionally boys)
seeking a better life as playmate and running off with one of the people
visiting the club.
