The Mythhunters are a private organisation of a number of students who
try to find and film the supernatural - a very dangerous hobby. They
appear to store their data on a central computer and communicate via a
(password-protected) forum.

Recently their numbers have dwindled somewhat, due to arrests and
deaths.
