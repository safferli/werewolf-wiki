A subdivision of the Petersburg police force, itself a subdivision of
the [Ministry of Internal Affairs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MVD),
the Admiralteyski Police Department mainly works together with the [St
Petersburg City
Administration](St_Petersburg_City_Administration "wikilink"). It
consists of a number of subdivisions:

  - Western Admiralteyski police department: This is where [Nievo
    Ashkov](Nievo_Ashkov "wikilink") works, and it is responsible for
    the [territory](territory "wikilink") of the
    [pack](Shadowclaws "wikilink"). It is housed in a building complex
    together with a fire department on a small island in the northwest
    of Admiralteyski.
  - Eastern Admiralteyski police department: Recently got a new head,
    [Eris Bobrov](Eris_Bobrov "wikilink"). He has a similar background
    to Nievo Ashkov and is already being hailed as his pupil and
    successor. There is a growing number of rumours that the two know
    each other well and worked a lot together. [Angus](Angus "wikilink")
    knows first-hand from Nievo that he didn't even know Eris' name a
    week ago. The new head is very popular and a supporter of
    [Neighbours for Neighbours](Neighbours_for_Neighbours "wikilink").

The
[Militsiya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militsiya#Militsiya_in_the_Russian_Federation),
as the police is called, is renowned for brutality and corruption, as
well as lack of funds. Quoted from the english wiki:

The results of a poll conducted on November 10, 2005, published by
Izvestia, show that 72% of people are afraid of militsiya because the
militiamen are thought to often take illegal actions against innocent
people. Another 2005 poll showed that 41% of the Russian population
fears the militsiya more than organized crime.

In contrast to this the local head of police, Nievo Ashkov, is very
popular and renowned for efficiency, honesty - and lack of funds.
