A spirit court situated at the [steel
works](Drnaya_Steel_Works "wikilink") in the pack's territory. The court
is large and very powerful, but stay within their borders (at least
while the pack stays out of theirs). They do not allow access to the
court's territory and are believed to kill on sight. They are known to
have at least one [locus in the
steelworks](locus_in_the_steelworks "wikilink").

Also semi part of this court is the locus in the pack's territory, in
[Angus](Angus "wikilink")' living area. A [locus of Hearth and
Homeliness](Heimeligkeitsfenster "wikilink"), where hobos meet and can
warm themselves. Due to the dual nature of home, fire and buildings,
this is future battleground. The pack has secured right of passage in
the Hearth locus.
