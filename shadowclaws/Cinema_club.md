A number of cinema afficionados have agreed to meet regularly to watch
and discuss films. [Angus](Angus "wikilink") met the group during the
pack early [quest for a Locus](conquest_of_the_Locus "wikilink"). He
kept friendly contacts with the group and occasionally joined them. The
club was nearly (and quite literally) killed during the
[fight](Fight_in_the_sewers#Spirit_Attacks "wikilink") against the
[Great Slimy One](Great_Slimy_One "wikilink"), as the acid fly maggath
attacked Angus (and the club members with him). Angus escaped, but most
of the club members were slain.

The pack, and Angus especially, has vowed to restart the club, part of a
bargain with the [Cinema Spirit](Cinema_Spirit "wikilink") in their
territory for information on the theatre spirits that plagued their
territory during the events of [the theatre spirits on the
loose](the_old_werewolf's_last_play#Theatre_Spirits_on_the_Loose "wikilink").
