Josuv is a young boy living in the pack's territory. He is part of a
gang from the hiphop milieu that regularly shows up at Grigor's boxing
sessions - although Josuv only came along once and didn't join them
since. The first time he was there, he lost his nerve, attacking his
training partner. When Grigor stopped him, he went crazy and ran out of
the building. The pack had little time to find him since, so he is
presumably somewhere out there. His father was contacted (after a small
"misunderstanding") in an effort to find the boy.

#### Description

Josuv is a inconspicuous seventeen-year-old. He is sometimes the victim
of childish mockery due to his smooth face and his long brown hair --
though that usually ends soon, since Josuv is prone to losing his
temper. He's usually dressed in oversized clothing and a cap depicting
the emblem of the St. Petersburg ice hockey club.
