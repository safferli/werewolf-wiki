The [pack](pack "wikilink") has friendly ties towards cat spirits, a
part of the [Urban Ronins](Urban_Ronins "wikilink"), not only because
the [totem](totem "wikilink") is a cat spirit. The pack also protects
the cats in the sewer mazes from attacks of the dog spirits. In
exchange, the cats act as information gatherers and disseminaters.
