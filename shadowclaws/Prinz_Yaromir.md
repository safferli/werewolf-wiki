A spirit of a [now-destroyed
theatre](garbage-burning_facility "wikilink") of at Greater Jaggling
rank. It seems Prince Yaromir is a spirit of acting and theater in
general, a fact he [impressively displayed](reality_theatre "wikilink")
by manipulating the werewolves of Petersburg so they unwittingly
participated in a play designed to strengthen his
[court](Court_of_Eternal_Grace "wikilink").

Probably not coincidently, this is also the name of the male main
character of a famous (in Russia, that is) russian theatre play, based
on an old tale.

Strangely, another name this spirit goes by is [Eternal
Grace](Eternal_Grace "wikilink") - a name shared by another Greater
Jaggling of his court, [the maiden](the_maiden "wikilink").
