Nevskys Sword is a [Steel Predator](Steel_Predators "wikilink"), the
[spirit](spirits "wikilink") of the [Alexander Nevsky
Bridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Nevsky_Bridge) located at
the eastern border of the no-mans-land, bordering the
[Glasfelle](Glasfelle "wikilink") territory and close to the [Crimson
Tears](Crimson_Tears "wikilink"). Still, its influence stretches right
to the current eastern border of the
[Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink").

The spirit is very powerful, its name evokes a certain awe in the Hisil
of Petersburg. According to [Andrei
Wind-in-den-Straßen](Andrei_Wind-in-den-Straßen "wikilink"), it is of
Greater Jaggling rank and he and his pack go to a certain length to
prevent provocating it. He says the name is from a famous quote of the
russian hero Alexander Nevsky, namesake of the bridge: "He who comes to
us with a sword, from a sword will perish.". The bridge feeds on all
passing spirits, and it has a number of "spirit packs" at its service
that drive or lure prey to the bridge, feeding on the scraps left by the
powerful Jaggling.
