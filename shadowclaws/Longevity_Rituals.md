Most magi in the [Rhine Tribunal](Rhine_Tribunal "wikilink") try to
obtain their first Longevity Ritual about 10-15 years after their
Gauntlet, while they still have the status of tyro (journeyman). There
are a variety of possibilities:

  - A minority of magi craft a Longevity Ritual for themselves. (These
    are usually those with a talent for Creo and/or Corpus.)
  - Some young magi follow the tradition of seeking out their parens for
    their first Longevity Ritual. (If they enjoy good relations and the
    master is suitably skilled, that is.)
  - Some seek out an elder magus from within their own gild.
  - Some seek out some other Rhine magus who they believe to be an
    expert in Creo and/or Corpus.
  - Some seek out a magus in another Tribunal.
  - Most Redcaps will sooner or later be provided with a Longevity
    Ritual crafted by a Mercere or Verditius magus.

The Rhine Tribunal is not unfortunately not currently blessed with any
magi or covenants known to have a great focus or expertise with
longevity. Still, there are some possibilities:

  - The magi of [Dankmar](Dankmar "wikilink") are believed to be capable
    of creating potent Longevity Rituals -- or at least it has been
    noted how they have been able to produce daughters at an advanced
    age. However due to their seclusion and generally poor reputation,
    almost no-one seeks them out for help.
  - Igor Rastvan of [Roznov](Roznov "wikilink") is known as a master of
    Corpus and has a splendid lab which is highly suitable. However he
    is a proud and rich man, and so surely he would not deign to offer
    his service to a mere journeyman unless the price was very high.
  - Petrus Virilis of [Durenmar](Durenmar "wikilink") is rumoured to
    know something about fertility magics, or at least his former
    mistress was famed as an expert in Creo and Corpus, plus he has
    fathered several Gifted children. He is too young to have great
    expertise, but he could probably craft a passable Longevity Ritual?
  - There are probably one or two magi at
    [Fengheld](Fengheld "wikilink") who are skilled enough to produce a
    standard Longevity Ritual for a fair price.

Given the relative lack of expertise in the Tribunal, it is not
altogether uncommon for magi to travel to other Tribunals to seek out a
longevity expert. Possibilities include:

  - Sinews of Knowledge in the Greater Alps Tribunal is renowned as a
    Bonisagus research covenant with a great expertise in longevity. It
    is close to the Rhine Tribunal, being just south of the River
    Danube, and the two Tribunals have generally good relations. The
    covenant also has close relations with Durenmar. Several Rhine magi
    have Longevity Rituals created here.
  - Some magi from Requies Aeterna in the Normandy Tribunal used to be
    skilled with longevity as well as banishing the undead, although if
    recent news is to be believed, the covenant is in a state of
    decline.
  - There are likely one or two longevity specialists of House Verditius
    at their domus magna, Verdi, in the Roman Tribunal.
  - The covenant of Epidauros in the far-flung Theban Tribunal
    supposedly produces Longevity Rituals of a legendary quality, or so
    the Redcaps say.
  - Coeris, or some other covenant in the Transylvanian Tribunal, is
    presumed to be home to some longevity experts, because several Rhine
    Tremere magi travel there to obtain one, and most of the Rhine
    Tremere are believed to have powerful Longevity Rituals.

## Vexator's Longevity Ritual

After consulting with the redcaps and other magi, Vexator counts his
options. He's like a truly excellent potion, price is only of secondary
importance. He'll send letters via redcaps and also talk to the magi of
the tribunal during the Tribunal:

  - Older magus of the guild: Igor Rastvan. Butter him up, brown-nosing,
    etc. Let's see what he demands\!
  - Epidaurus: If they're *that* good, ask for the price and how long it
    would take to get there.
  - Sinews of Knowledge: ask for an excellent LR there.
  - Verdi: ask for the price of an excellent LR there.

## Aphanius' Longevity Ritual

Aphanius still has some years left before he needs a Longevity Ritual,
but since planning never hurts, he will enquire at the House Tremere
Meeting what the price tag of a Coeris Ritual is.
