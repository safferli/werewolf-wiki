Things to do for the Werewolf part of the wiki:

Work to do:

  - clear up the history of the pack, especially the unknown part
    between the initiation and the great slimy one. Any contributions
    here are welcome\! If you only remember some rough details, just
    write them in the discussion on [this](Timeline "wikilink") page,
    perhaps they are helpful to someone.

There is currently discussion on the following articles, where you can
voice your opinion:

  - [This one](Talk:ToDo:Werewolf "wikilink")

<!-- end list -->

  - [What to do with the saga page?](Talk:St_Petersburg_Saga "wikilink")

  - [If you have any notes on the missing intervals, please add them
    here.](Talk:Timeline "wikilink")

<!-- end list -->

    Unnecessary?](Talk:Summer_Garden "wikilink")

<!-- end list -->

  - [WoD-Wiki-Linking: I think it's a good idea (it's Martins idea, not
    mine). What do you think?](Talk:Die_Amazone "wikilink")

Please link any further articles you start a discussion on here. Or tell
me how to find articles with a talk page : )
