Located in a commercial area in the west of Admiralteyski, Spartak
cinema is a center where much of the local youth meets, though it has
lost importance with the emergence of the [youth
club](youth_club "wikilink") to the south. Still, since the old theatre
has been converted to a [garbage-burning
facility](garbage-burning_facility "wikilink"), it has become the main
cultural centre of western Admiralteyski. It tries to live up to this
status by showing a wide variety of movies, though much of the
avant-garde scene has moved on to smaller bars in the area.

The [spirit](cinema_Spirit "wikilink") of the cinema is very much alive
and appears to be of Jaggling rank. Though the pack has made two deals
with the spirit in the past (which turned out well), not much is known
about it.

[Angus](Angus "wikilink") runs a small [cinema
club](cinema_club "wikilink") that meets here once a month, part of a
recent deal with the spirit.
