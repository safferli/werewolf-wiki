There is a big locus in the sewers of Admiralteyski. It has been the
place of the pack's fight against the [Great Slimy
One](Great_Slimy_One "wikilink"). It is not known if this locus existed
before the coming of the waste spirit, or if both were in fact created
by the [disposal of hazardous waste into the
sewers](fight_in_the_sewers "wikilink"). The locus was aligned to fresh
water by a complicated ritual performed by [Angus](Angus "wikilink"),
and is now fiercely contested by the sewers spirit population. The pack
has kept out of the fighting for the time being, content that the
spirits are busy with one another and no threat to their territory at
the moment.
