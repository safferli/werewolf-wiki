A pack of werewolves who claim their territory to the north of the
Shadowclaws. Part of the [alliance](alliance "wikilink") of werewolves
in central St. Petersburg.

"Litanei der Straßen" is probably a more typical pack of werewolves.
They largely mind their own business, resent any interference by
outsiders and protect their territory fiercely. They have a certain
esoteric touch, and it is not known what their pack totem is. In fact
little is known about the pack beside its members and its very
territorial nature - except that they keep their territory clean and
that it is supposedly very unhealthy to enter it unannounced.

"Litanei der Straßen" has had little dealings with the
[Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink"), partially because of their
reclusiveness, but also because their territories do not border. Only
Yelena and [Grigor](Grigor "wikilink") have met at times, due to their
common [lodge](Bear_Hunters "wikilink") - the
[Enlightened](Enlightened "wikilink") members of the pack regularly
attend the (rare) meetings of the lodge, but neither had much talk with
[Angus](Angus "wikilink") outside of
that.
