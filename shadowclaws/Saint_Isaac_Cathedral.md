[Saint Isaac's
Cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Isaac%27s_Cathedral) is
the largest church building in Saint Petersburg, seat of the city's
[epsicop](Dorofey_Evgenikov "wikilink") and a famous symbol of the glory
of Imperial Russia. The church is named after the patron saint of Peter
the Great himself.

The building was closed after the second world war, and turned into a
museum of atheism by the Soviet regime. Only after the fall of the iron
curtain was it reopened, and service resumed - although only in a small
side chapel, because the episcop's health does not permit him performing
service in the richly decorated main hall.

Recently, the building has been closed to the public and visitors, to
allow measurements for the construction of a subway line.
