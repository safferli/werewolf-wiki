A strange breed of spirit and flesh, the Rhaglu appear as sheep-sized
wasps. Little is known about them, and it took Angus days to find their
name even with help of the [Enlightened](Enlightened "wikilink"). The
few facts that are known are:

  - They are not Spirits (at least not fully). The Ithalunim did not
    even know the names of them.
  - They seem to posses strength in numbers. A lone Rhaglu is weak, but
    when the [pack](Shadowclaws "wikilink") was
    [ambushed](Breeding_Grounds "wikilink") by 7 of them it was almost
    wiped out.
  - They have a hive-like structure, as there are many underneath [St.
    Nicholaus Cathedral](St._Nicholaus_Cathedral "wikilink"). At least 3
    types exist: Simple 'workers' wo make up the majority, fierce
    warriors wo seem primarily concerned with protecting the nest, and
    queens which probably function as some sort of hive mind, as she is
    not needed for laying eggs.
  - They procreate by laying eggs into humans, which then hatch within
    about a month, consuming their hosts. They favour wolfblooded since
    these have a higher-than-average stamina, allowing for more eggs to
    successfully hatch. All workers can lay eggs, not only the queen.
  - They have a basic understanding of human society, hiding their
    victims and acting as to not draw too much attention.
  - They seem to communicate based on scent, and supernaturally strong
    odours are known to disrupt their unity, making them far easier to
    battle.
