A [court](spirits "wikilink") consisting of the spirits of larger
animals (mainly cats, birds, dogs) that live in the city. The spirits
are usually quite solitary (even the dogs) and quite paranoid. It is
rumoured they will not accept gifts of essence, a behaviour stemming
from a number of attempts by the city's population to kill their
physical counterparts by laying out poisoned food.

The pack has good connections in particular to the [Cat
Spirits](Cat_Spirits "wikilink"), since their [totem](totem "wikilink")
comes from this brood. The dogs are therefore natural opponents, while
most birds seem content to ignore them.

This court has traditionally good ties with the [Court of Eternal
Grace](Court_of_Eternal_Grace "wikilink") -- a rare thing in the spirit
world.
