[Saint Petersburg
Underground](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg_Metro) is the
subway system of Saint Petersburg. Built in the Soviet era, most
stations are renowned for majestic construction. In recent years, the
system has replaced the tram system as the major form of public
transport. With the planned addition of more station, this trend is
likely to continue.

There are no stations beyond the territory claimed by the
[Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink"), though some are planned, and the
unclaimed land to the east has the central stations where most lines
cross.

After a failed attempt at introducing a general speed limit of 30 kmh in
the city center, the authorities seem determined to expand the system,
adding a number of new stations, one of which would lie in the territory
of the Shadowclaws. However, due to intricacies with the extensive
cellars of many of the old buildings in the city center and the
prominence of underground cavities and rivers in the area, work is
unlikely to begin anytime soon.

The company operating the system, privatised after the fall of the iron
curtain, is currently in dispute with the [St Petersburg Cultural
Heritage
Authority](St_Petersburg_Cultural_Heritage_Authority "wikilink") due to
their expansion plans affecting some old buildings.
