[Grigor](Grigor "wikilink") leads a number of young boys from the south
of the [pack's](Shadowclaws "wikilink") territory, working for the
mafia.

After his first change, his position as a bouncer quickly became
untenable, but luckily he emerged from the tumultuous first weeks with a
good reputation for taking initiative - something that [Vladimir
Wecek](Vladimir_Wecek "wikilink") told him his bosses were glad about,
and he was assigned to the new [youth club](youth_club "wikilink") to
recruit some young lads and whip them into shape. He has since succeeded
in this, acquiring about a dozen followers, called the "foreign legion"
since there are no native Russians among them.

All the boys from the foreign legion are quite young, in the range of 16
to 20. Without exception, they come from poor families living in one of
the worst areas in the territory, and grew up spending lots of time on
the streets. They see Grigor as a bit of a father figure, a strong hand
that has finally given some purpose to their existence - even if that
purpose is lying, stealing, violence and murder. It is no secret that
all of them are more than a bit afraid of their leader, but they keep
their mouths shut about his eccentricities.

Grigor has blood samples from all of his guys, and has tasted their
blood so he can track them down fast. This has not been necessary yet,
but as a precaution, it is certainly good. It is unknown how much
Grigor's superiors know about his strange practices, or how much they
care as long as he gets the jobs done.
