Yorek "Howl-from-beyond" is an ageing Ghost Wolf gone mad. It seems that
he never was able to stay in a place for long, and therefore wandered
the wide lands of Siberia for most of his life. During these travels he
encountered an old castle, where he found a festering danger that would
affect a large number of packs in the wider area. Unable to stop it, he
committed himself to slow it down, growing ever more desperate as he
aged. No one knows how long he spend giving his shows, performing
rituals that held it at bay.

At some point he must have felt that he could not hold on much longer,
so he sought out his daughter to pass on the burden. Instead, he found
the [Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink"), who were able to
[resolve](the_old_werewolf's_last_play "wikilink") his problem with a
concerted effort. Yorek went back to Siberia, and no one has heard of
him since then. The story how he willingly gave his mind to stop a
powerful spirit from passing into the world has been retold by
[Grigori](Grigori "wikilink") and [Edouard](Edouard "wikilink"), and is
growing in popularity, especially among Ghost Wolves.
