The pack is not very wealthy -- or at least wasn't until
[Edouard](Edouard_Lambert "wikilink")'s arrival -- but has accumulated a
small amount of stuff. [Grigor](Grigor "wikilink") and
[Aleksandr](Aleksandr "wikilink") both have shady contacts where they
are able to source some weapons and technical equipment. Thanks to

computers, light machinery, chemicals, and one motor boat.
