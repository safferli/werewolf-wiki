[Palace Square](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_Square) is a square
in central St. Petersburg, located in the no-man's-land between the
[Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink") and the
[Glasfelle](Glasfelle "wikilink"). It is the historical center of the
civil city (opposite the military and political centre, the [Peter and
Paul Fortress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Paul_Fortress))
and site of several events of world-wide importance. Unsurprisingly,
there is also a very lively hisil here.

The pack did not yet venture to explore the spirit side of square. They
know, though, that there is a monthly
[court](The_High_Court_of_Petersburg "wikilink") here, residing on
nights of the full moon. They used it
[once](The_fate_of_The_Bleeding_Stone "wikilink") to get to a
[spirit](The_Bleeding_Stone "wikilink") which they could not hunt down.
