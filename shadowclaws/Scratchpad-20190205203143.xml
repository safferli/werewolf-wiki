      <comment>/* City */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4899">This page contains a general overview of the setting and important parts of the saga.

===City===

Some information on the city (in case of conflicting statements, information on this wiki takes precedence):
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg St. Petersburg]

A map of some of the no-man's-land in the City Center:

[[Image:PetersburgTerritory.jpg]]

A map showing the territory claimed by Forsaken packs (some things are different, e.g. the subway stations in the no-mans-land don't exist yet):

[[Image:packs.jpg]]

The territory claimed by the [[Shadowclaws]] is the part marked by the red line. The dotted red line shows the territory of the [[Spirits of Fire and Steel]], where the player's claim is only nominal. The area to the north and east is claimed by [[Schatten der Zaren]] und [[Glasfelle]], respectively. In the south is the former territory of [[Rote Wut]]. Since the pack was a quite bloodthirsty one, this area should be considered dangerous at best. The spiritscape is reportedly a huge mess of former allies and enemies of Rote Wut battling for control. Recently, the last surviving member of Rote Wut moved in with a [[Crimson Tears|new pack]], but they seem to have a hard time regaining control of the territory.

Most of the closer Terra Incognita appears to be residential and industrial areas. The area is not claimed by any pack.

Some interesting places in the no-man's-land to the east of the pack's territory are listed in the [[:Category:Setting|setting]] category.

The [[Admiralteyski Wochenblatt]] is a local newspaper published somewhat irregularly in this part of the city.

===Territory===

The packed carved out a small piece of land in western [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiralteysky_District Admiralteysky] as their [[territory]]. The choice was not really theirs, as an alliance of some packs in the city centre more or less showed them where a good place for a new pack would be. At least they provided some initial help.  [[Aleksandr]] grew up in this part of the city and [[Grigor]] had lived there for a number of years, which probably turned out be more of a problem than a boon.

===Locus===

The pack's main [[old radio|locus]] is an information locus located in the newly-established environmental supervisory division of the [[St Petersburg Sewage and Waste Authority]]. [[Angus]] works here, so the pack has easy access to the locus. It is located in the computer of the chief of the unit. Recently, Angus was promoted acting chief, so the locus is actually in his own office now. 

===Dramatis Personae===

Some of the territories inhabitants have regular Dealings with the werewolves, for various reasons. This is an incomplete list of important NPC's in the territory.

{|cellpadding=5

|-
|[[Nievo Ashkov]]||Chef of Police in the pack's territory||

|-
|[[Josuv Stanov]]||a kid from the streets, exhibiting a very strange behaviour||
|-
|[[Vladimir Wecek]]||Mafiosi, usually the contact of [[Grigor]]||
|}


There are also some important NPCs living outside the packs territory - mainly other werewolves.

|-
|[[Die Amazone]]||A werewolf to the south of the pack, Cahalith and now alpha, involved with the players on a number of occasions||
|}

===Factions===

Besides the various [[:Category:Angus' Spirit Almanac|spirit courts]], there are currently four other packs in the area that are known to the [[Shadowclaws]], all them are part of a loose [[alliance]]:

The pack [[Schatten der Zaren]], the most senior pack in the city and the centre of the alliance.

[[Glasfelle]], a smaller pack to the far east of the Shadowclaws. They usually stick to themselves, but have worked as teachers for the [[Shadowclaws]].

The pack [[Litanei der Straßen]], a secretive and disciplined pack to the northeast of the Shadowclaws' territory.

There was also [[Rote Wut]], a pack of Ghost Wolves with a kill on sight policy. They were not members of the alliance and where recently almost extinguished in a [[Battle against Rote Wut|fight]] with the Shadowclaws.

[[Die Amazone]], the sole survivor of the conflict with the Shadowclaws, has founded a new pack reclaiming the former territory of Rote Wut. They run under the name [[Crimson Tears]].

Almost all werewolves in the area are also part of one of the [[lodge|lodges]] of their tribe.

===Houserules===

The [[Houserules]] of the group.

After finishing his education at the Universite de Montreal he assumed several job positions, finally ending up as manager at Bombardier Aeronautique, where he is responsible for the negotiations with other business partners.

It is not quite clear why he and his long time girlfriend broke up about a year ago, but his long working hours and his frequent business travels to russia certainly didn't help to improve his relation.

After his arrival in Saint Petersburg and his [[First Change]], he took a while to get used to his new life as a werewolf, but finally attained a position as CIO on the board of [[Menatep Bank]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1289">Wissendes Auge der Nacht is a stray cat spirit encountered by the pack during their rite of initiation. After the spirit repeatedly stole essence from an area the pack was guarding, they tracked it down and gave it a simple choice: Become our totem or perish.

Wissendes Auge der Nacht does not trust easily - as is reflected in its ban. The initial relationship with the pack was quite strained, given the blunders the newly changed werewolves made during their first dealings with the spirit wild. However, as they worked toward securing their territory, the spirit became a valuable ally, particularly in their struggle against the [[Great Slimy One]].

The Chorus Numina allows Wissendes Auge der Nacht to call upon other [[Cat Spirits|cat spirits]] in the territory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3707">The founding members of the pack faced their Rite of Initiation together. They all underwent their [[First Change]] within a month, so the elder werewolves in St. Petersburg decided that the time was right to found a new pack, instead of separating the cubs and reinforcing existent packs. After the young werewolves agreed (what choice did they have?) and each chose a tribe (except for Grigori, who preferred to remain unaffiliated), the elder werewolves decided that it would teach the new pack how to work together if they had to face their Initiation challenge not individually, but as a team. Only the very last step, the actual Initiation into the tribe, would be conducted separately, since the packmembers chose different tribes.

Their task was to find and eliminate the source of a recent killing rampage that had broken out near the centre. Initial investigations soon pointed to a park in the northwestern part of Petrogradsky. The pack went to investigate and were attacked by a strange beast in the shape of a bear. Their enemy delivered forceful blows, sending a werewolf to the ground with only one or two hits and proved too much to handle. The pack was forced to retreat and return the next day.

After investigating the site, they found a locus in a statue of one of the city's heroes from the Great Patriotic War. With information obtained from the local spirits, they were able to find out that their enemy was very likely an ancient vampire with little humanity, recently awakened from long torpor. His hiding place was inside the statue that represented the locus -- which meant it would be difficult to force him out. However, they found out that if the locus were to be destroyed, the resulting supernatural ripples would most likely disable the magic that kept the creature in the statue, ejecting it into the outside world. The problem, though, was that the local spirits naturally were not particularly well-disposed towards the idea of destroying their locus. After promising to help rebuild it after the fight, the werewolves entered a 'non-aggression-agreement' with the resident spirits.

They gathered on a sunny afternoon the next day, waiting until no witness was close by. Destroying the locus proved to be easy, and shortly after that a big male person emerged from the statue -- only to instantly catch fire and change into an enormous bear. The monstrosity, brightly ablaze, charged the closest werewolf, but was only able to take a few steps before it crumbled to dust.

The following month was spend reconstructing the locus, which proved to be far more difficult than its destruction had been. As the locus was aligned with hope, they had to reinforce any sentiments of hope nearby, or have hopeful people come to the statue. Still, this proved to be the lesser problem -- the gathering essence attracted all kinds of spirits, and the pack had to keep a constant watch in the Hisil to prevent the essence from being consumed. It was during this vigil that they first made contact with [[Wissendes Auge der Nacht]], their future pack totem which at this point had made a loose alliance with a number of other cat spirits. Using the cover of darkness (and the shadow influence of Wissendes Auge der Nacht), they were often able to steal some essence while the werewolves were busy keeping the flood of smaller spirits at bay. This was only ended after the pack set out to track Wissendes Auge der Nacht down, and force it into the pack.

After this the remaining resistance was overcome and the locus rebuilt. In a number of ceremonies the young werewolves were [[Tribe Initiations|introduced into their respective tribes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2785">==Angus McFadden (Angus Swims-under-Ice)==

Born in Scotland, but his parents returned to the Shetland Islands when he was four. His grandparents owned a small island near Uyea, but his parents moved to Lerwick on the main island. Angus held a few odd jobs, including owning a small tourist diving enterprise. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Angus decided that a little holiday to St. Petersburg would be a good idea -- the idea of a large town, surrounded by ice, snow, lakes and the Baltic for diving appealed to him. 

Little did he know that his holiday in St. Petersburg turned out to be a extended stay, after his [[First Change]] prevented him from leaving the city or returning back to the Shetland islands -- probably for ever.

Angus tries to collect all available information on spirits in general and on spirits in the pack's territory in particular. His calls his collection affectionately [[:Category:Angus' Spirit Almanac|Angus' Spirit Almanac]].

The pack claims one locus as their own, the [[Old radio]]. They have right of passage at two more loci, the [[Heimeligkeitsfenster]] and the [[Black locus]], and are entitled to one third of the essence generated by the last one.

===Resources===

Here is a list of [[equipment]] currently available to the pack. Most of the pack hold (more or less regular) jobs that provide for their needs. Only Edouard has income far beyond this, being able to provide substantial funds for the packs projects.

The pack has a number of useful contacts entertained by some of its members. They provide an insight into the ongoings in the city administration, criminal activities and business interests, as well as making it (relatively) easy for the pack to aquire more exotic chemicals and weapons.

===Relations===

The pack is not well known as an entity in general, which is how the werewolves like it. After all, they don't want to draw to much attention. Most in the district have heard of the 'Shadowclaws' gang, and there is rumour that they are actually out to do good, even if it often does not appear so. Noone could name a member, though.

Naturally, the duty of werewolves often brings them into conflict with police (a dead ridden looks just like any other dead person). This has escalated once, but the pack managed to shift the blame on a criminal organisation. Since the head of police is good friends with Angus, the pack mostly manages to avoid trouble in this direction.

(other mundanes and spirits still missing)

===OOC Rumours===
Some Uratha whisper stories about the pack's strange initiation rite. Although the truth of these stories is a bit unclear, it is said that the real initiation is complete when the new member has shown its allegiance toward the pack in body and spirit, meaning the initiate has to lose most of her health and must have only a minimum of essence left in order to be considered a true pack mate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="762">The 'Great Slimy One' was a lesser Jaggling that manifested in the sewers due to the biological waste [[fight in the sewers|transported there by some criminal elements]]. It quickly took over the main locus in the sewers (situated right on the origin of the contamination), replacing [[Athumu]], and established its own court. In the following weeks, the court grew stronger and stronger, until it was the predominant court throughout most of the sewers.

The [[Giftläufer]] were a kind of spirit that provided muscle for his court, and an enemy the pack repeatedly faced.

He was eventually discorporated by the pack and subsequently destroyed during the [[fight in the sewers|cleansing of its locus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3366">The fight in the sewers was a long campaign fought by the pack against the [[Great Slimy One]] and a number of criminal elements in the district administration.

===Prelude===

The whole problem started when a part of a southern mafia organisation (not the one [[Grigor]] was part of) started disposing hazardous waste into the sewers for various companies, bribing parts of the district administration.

((I'm a bit uncertain about the timeline here. It's been a while, and I'm not getting any younger. Feel free to help out by correcting stuff))

The pack became aware of the problem as a spirit fleeing the Hisil claimed the son of an important businessman (and member of the mafia Grigor is part of) in the area. The pack hunted him down and extracted the spirit, just to find out that there's something strange going on. Further investigation revealed a company involved in illegal deals inside the packs territory. While the Irraka and some of his human associates broke into the company's headquarter to gather more information on the enterprise, the Rahu and his mafia friends took the entire factory where the missing man had been found out -- it was a bloodbath. Finally, the Ithaeur was able to identify the spot where the waste was dumped into the sewer, and used his job at the [[St Petersburg Sewage and Waste Authority]] to bring the matter to the attention of the public.

===Spirit Attacks===

At the same time, there was a series of attacks by three different maggaths. A strange mutation of rusty steel pipes killed several citizens, before [[Angus]] and [[Grigor]] managed to put it down. An acid fly harassed several of the packmembers, before they could pin the spirit down and discorporate it. A strange aggression seemed to grip most of the dogs in the territory, until the pack found their locus attacked by a dog-wrath maggath. Their Rahu was able to best it in a duel, forcing it to leave the area for at least a hundred years. The pack met [[Nadja Ivanetsch]], a possibly innocent girl that unluckily got muddled up in the affairs. Eventually, they traced these attacks back to the [[Great Slimy One]], which had made a move to eject the werewolves from the area, thereby eliminating one of the major remaining threats to its rule.

===Fighting in the Sewers===

In the following weeks, the pack scouted the spirit side of the sewers, seeking knowledge about their enemy and allies for the fight. They were eventually able to bring some steel spirits in alongside them, and learned a ritual to turn the locus of contaminated water into one of clean water with the help of the [[Prince of the River]]. If successful, this would directly cut off the [[Great Slimy One]]'s essence supply, preventing his &quot;rebirth&quot;. However, the locus was still guarded by the powerful spirit itself, and it had assembled a loyal court of followers, along with some allied spirit courts.

===The Final Battle===

The resulting battle was the most epic fought by the pack to date. They infiltrated the locus, attacked from different angles, discorporated the [[Great Slimy One]] after a heroic struggle and held control of the locus long enough for their Ithaeur to complete the ritual. The [[Great Slimy One]] was destroyed, but the power vacuum he left behind would give the pack troubles for quite some time, still.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1778">The Battle against [[Rote Wut]] was only a real battle for the last few days of the conflict. Before that, members of [[Rote Wut]] -- especially '[[Die Amazone]]' -- infiltrated the southern part of the packs territory and stirred conflict among the restless youth. They also tried to turn some spirit courts against the werewolves. However, they only succeeded with that part because [[Grigor]] antagonized the [[Spirits of Order]] by killing some local law enforcement officers ((something along those lines at last - don't remember exactly)). The [[Rote Wut]] was also responsible for setting up the waste disposal, which resulted in the [[Fight in the sewers|battle]] against the [[Great Slimy One]]. 

When [[Edouard Lambert|Edouard]] arrived, things went downward. [[Grigor]] killed the alpha of [[Rote Wut]], 'Stahlknochen', in a disagreement on their border, and 'Rote Wut' tried to hunt down the freshly changed Cahalith on their ground. The Canadian businessman made it back to his hotel, where 'Klauenwind' and the [[Shadowclaws]] arrived at about the same time. In the resulting chase, [[Angus]] was severely injured by the Ghost Wolf Rahu, but [[Edouard Lambert|Edouard]] got away. After some convincing, he joined the pack that came to his rescue. When they were confronted by 'Die Amazone', who almost killed Edouard, they managed to convince her she was fighting for the wrong side -- following wrong visions, tainted by Rabid Wolf. That turned the tide of battle, and with inside information they were able to kill the Pure werewolf in their territory, pacify the hostile spirit court and finally put an end to a police investigation running since quite some time. Even the fighting amongst the youth seemed to go back.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1913">The pack 'Rote Wut' was the southern neighbour of the [[Shadowclaws]]. The packs [[Battle against Rote Wut|recently clashed]] over territorial issues and the fate of [[Edouard Lambert|Edouard]].

Three of the four former Members of 'Rote Wut' perished in the conflict, and the last survivour founded a new pack, [[Crimson Tears]].

Only '[[Die Amazone]]', a Ghost Wolf Cahalith, survived the fight - though she was half the reason it started. Having visions of utter destruction wrought upon the werewolves of St. Petersbourgh by the advent of [[Edouard Lambert|Edouard]], her pack set out to destroy him, and the pack that always aided him in the visions - the [[Shadowclaws]]. She realized the mistake only when she realized the young werewolf was also a Cahalith, blessed by the mother just like her. She proved essential in helping the pack clean up the mess. Upon returning from a journey, she started reclaiming the territory of Rote Wut with the help of the Crimson Tears.

'Klauenwind' was a Ghost Wolf Rahu, far beyond the border of sanity. Her Harmony had dropped to very low levels, but she was still a fighting machine able to take on the best the [[Shadowclaws]] had to offer. When the fighting intensified, she finally lost her grip on sanity completely, and remains missing as of now.

Sergey 'Stahlknochen' Ivanovich, the leader of the pack, was killed in a border fight with [[Grigor]], who unwisely took his head home as a trophy, thereby starting an open war.

The last member of 'Rote Wut' was Flammenfell, a Pure spy, only being able to pass along 'Rote Wut' because the pack had lost too much Harmony to see him for what he was. A servant of Rabid Wolf, he had infected the dreams of the packs Cahalith, in order to start a war among the Forsaken, a war whose sole winner would be the pure surrounding the city, waiting for their chance to strike.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1769">&quot;An honest, bullish and sensible man. A rare thing in these times,and even rarer in the police.&quot;
Oscar Wilde ... er, no Angus on Nievo Ashkov

Nievo Ashkov is and was - except for a short period during the turmoil of the  [[Battle against Rote Wut|fight against Rote Wut]] - the chief of police for the district containing the pack's territory, leading one of the [[Admiralteyski Police Department|Admiralteyski Departments]]. He and Angus crossed path during the investigation of the [[Fight in the sewers|waste disposal scandal]]. He is somewhat reluctant to trust the scottish man with the mysterious sources of knowledge, but other than that they come along just fine. Nievo seems to be quite pleased to see another civil servant actually caring about his job.

The two befriended even more during the events around [[the fate of The Bleeding Stone]], when they were attacked enroute to the police station in Nievo's private car. Nievo now seems to count Angus among his personal friends, although he is still somewhat hesitant to talk about business, sense there is something strange with the 'simple man' who gets involved in almost anything.

===Description===
Nievo Ashkov is in his late thirties. His whole demeanour conveys authority: brawny, with just the right amount of fat, short blond hair, a stern face and blueish grey eyes with that look one only attains after years of practice as a law enforcement officer. A scar runs from his right eye to the right ear, turning red when he gets angry - a good sign that one should leave. The pistol and flashlight on his belt are accompanied by a multifunctional tool, a knife and his cell phone. His voice is deep and firm - and usually a bit louder than necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1260">A powerful [[spirits|spirit court]] concerned with everything that keeps a city &quot;running&quot; - trade, traffic, electricity ... the list is long, and many spirits belong to this court. The court is not young, probably reaching back to the first cities, but it has changed a lot over time and certainly grown more powerful in the modern world, where cities have surged in importance.

Blood of the City has very weird internal rules and structures. It seems the court is organised in &quot;boards&quot; (which might mean brood or not), who cover certain areas of activity. There also exists some strange feudal structure, perhaps a relict of older days, that is based on the transfer of essence: Paying essence to a spirit makes him your liege. A liege is supposed to speak on all matters that concern his vassals, but this vassals may still speak on matters that concern others, for example their own vassals. It is not unheard of for circles of allegiance to form (A is lord of B is lord of C is lord of A). All this, and the fact that Blood of the City can be quite unified if there is a threat, makes the court difficult and trying to deal with.

[[The Director]] is a Jaggling member the players have dealt with.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1774">A spirit of lesser Jaggling rank, also known as &quot;lost Daughter&quot;. She embodies the concepts of mourning and fear of losing someone/something. She often appears as a large foetus in red clothes. Her first concept was the spirits of the aborted children of prostitutes, hence her appearance. Originally she was part of the [[Red Choir]], but she escaped during the events of the [[fight in the sewers]]. There currently seems to be some infighting in [[Grey Court|her court]]. 

The pack (or rather [[Aleksandr]] bargaining generously on the pack's behalf) made a deal with it, to save [[Ivana]]'s life. The deal is valid as long as Ivana lives, so the pack has a safe way out should the need arise. Aleksandr would probably oppose it, but [[Angus]] seems quite willing to use this threat at least as a bargaining chip. 

The deal compromises the following points:

* Both parties will refrain from any path of action that could lead to direct attacks on the other parties. This is basically a non-aggression treaty with the added security of not being allowed to use third parties against one another.
* The pack will be allowed to use her main [[Black locus|locus]] to cross the Gauntlet, and the Werewolves are entitled to a third of the essence generated by the locus.
* In return, the werewolves are bound by oath to help defend the locus in rough times, to fight their common enemies from the [[Grey Court]] and to assist her in tracking down spirits of her retinue that go rogue.

[[Breeding Grounds|Recently]], the spirit has acquired another [[old altar|locus]], and gained control from the [[Rahglu]]. She-Who-Was–Eternally-Lost is now a name that is not spoken lightly in the Hisil of the pack's territory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3818">''&quot;You ever wondered how humans managed to conquer the earth, despite all their physical shortcomings? They work together. No matter if they see a common purpose or follow someone out of fear or love, that is their strength. And it's about damn time we learn that, too.&quot;''

The Enlightened are a [[lodge]] of Storm Lords in St. Petersburg. Most see them as relatively new -- a product of the [[alliance]] forged by [[Victor Flammendes-Schwert]] -- but there are rumours that it is based on a much older organisation. The lodge is mostly noted for keeping the alliance intact, and most packs of the alliance have an Enlightened member, who more often than not is the alpha. 

The members of the lodge see themselves as diplomats, collectors of knowledge and political leaders. Initiates have to prove themselves in these field to gain full access to the inner secrets of the lodge. What exactly these are is unknown, but it seems that a powerful spirit has allied itself with the lodge and grants several benefits.

The Lodge will never ask anyone to join, as this would be considered a sign of weakness. Instead, interested Storm Lords can announce their intention to join the Lodge, upon which they will be subjected to a [[Lodge Initiations#Angus' Lodge Initiation|trial]].

Upon being accepted into the lodge, [[Angus]] is now an Initiate of the Enlightened, which provides him with the free Merit Allies(Enlightened) 1.

As laid out by [[Victor Flammendes-Schwert]], to advance in the lodge the young Storm Lord has to carry out the duties the Lodge imposes upon their members:

* ''Librarian's Duty'': contribute an important piece of knowledge or wisdom to the lodge's ken.
** The pack's totem attests that by relating the story about the struggle for the [[The fate of The Bleeding Stone|fate]] of the spirit [[The Bleeding Stone|Bleeding Stone]], Angus has fulfilled this duty.
* ''Leader's Duty'': show your willingness to lead by successfully leading others through a dangerous situation.
** By leading his pack through the troubles while [[The fate of The Bleeding Stone|hunted by mortals]], Angus has fulfilled this duty in the pack totem's eyes. While he had the perfect place to hide and direct their efforts, he instead chose to come out and lead directly, thereby exposing him to great danger.
* ''Diplomat's Duty'': show your prowess in dealing with mortals, spirits or other supernaturals.
** The pack's totem attests that Angus has fulfilled this duty during his [[Angus crafting a Dog's Collar|creation of a Dog's Collar]].

Once a member has completed those duties -- witnessed and attested by his pack totem -- he will gain access to the [[The Legend of the Lodge of Enlightened|secrets]] of the lodge.

Membership in the lodge has the following mechanical benefits:

* Due to their totem and the dedication of the lodge to their task, members pay only two instead of three XP per dot for the Occult, Politics and Persuasion skills.
* The extensive collection of local tales and legends grants a +2 bonus on extended research rolls. The lodge's totem is free to charge a favour for access, though.

Known members of the lodge include:

* [[Victor Flammendes-Schwert]], High Judge of the lodge and the [[alliance]] it seeks to keep together, alpha of [[Schatten der Zaren]]
* [[Yossif Kradow]], an Irraka who prefers to stay in the background, also a member of Schatten der Zaren
* [[Vanya Sokolow]], the stern alpha of [[Litanei der Straßen]]
* [[Dima Kochegarov]], a Cahalith who seems to be the living record of the lodge and its lore; also a member of Litanei der Straßen
* [[Angus]], alpha of the [[Shadowclaws]]

There are likely a few more members from packs a bit further from the city center, who have not yet made an appearance in the story.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1276">Lodges in St Petersburg. 

===Storm Lords===

* [[Enlightened]]: promote (limited) coalition and helping between packs and werewolves
* Lodge of Winter: take the Storm Lord tribal oath even further
* Lodge of Crows: secretive and manipulative - usually members of the lodge of crows do not openly flaunt their allegiance, pretending to belong somewhere else instead

===Blood Talons===

* [[Blood Seekers]]: members of this lodge seek ever stronger foes, to improve their combat prowess beyond what even a Blood Talon might consider sane 
* [[Bear Hunters]]: the bear hunters emphasise group combat, be it with their pack or a group of trained humans
* Skalds: a lodge devoted to learning from former battles, keeping the lore of the old days and the great battles fought since the birth of the forsaken

===Iron Masters===

* [[Shepherds]]: they see human beings as the central part of their territories, and their understanding as a key to successfully carry out the Forsaken's duty
* [[Lightning]]: this lodge emphasises new technology as a tool to keep their territories clean
* [[Smiths]]: this lodge encompasses craftsmen of all kind and is devoted to keeping the knowledge of old and seeking new ways to apply trusted methods

Yelena is a very lively young woman, often found out partying. She has made clear on several occasions that she considers the Oath of the Moon to be 'a bit out-dated and old-fashioned'. Her facebook site has no less than 529 friends, tendency rising.

It seems Yelena has somewhat missed her call as a Ritemaster and Mystic, but her pack trusts her - when faced with a question about her suitability, the answer always is 'Don't judge a book by its cover'.

It seems Prince Yaromir is a spirit of acting and theater in general, a fact he [[reality theatre|impressively displayed]] by manipulating the werewolves of Petersburg so they unwittingly participated in a play designed to strengthen his [[Court of Eternal Grace|court]].

Probably not coincidently, this is also the name of the male main character of a famous (in Russia, that is) russian theatre play, based on an old tale.

Strangely, another name this spirit goes by is [[Eternal Grace]] - a name shared by another Greater Jaggling of his court, [[the maiden]].

* The pack will protect the EepEeps from other spirits.
* The pack owns the locus, giving them free access anytime they want.
* The EepEeps are entitled to half the essence generated by the locus. They inform the pack if there is trouble on their side of the locus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="990">'' 'Aleksandr's girlfriend.' ''&lt;br &gt;
-- Angus on Ivana


Ivana Njatiskova is a long-term friend of [[Aleksandr]]. They used to work in the same company, and have pulled quite a few criminal jobs together. Ivana is not aware of Aleksandr's change -- lately she had enough problems of her own, with a police investigation and an arrest warrant against her. She is currently hiding in the pack's territory, and usually communicates with Aleksandr via a Britney Spears fanpage. She helped in uncovering the waste disposal scandal.

===Description===
Ivana grew up with computers, and she lives with them. That shows: While she is not fat (and how would she, given how little she eats), she certainly isn't the athletic type. Her clothing is usually pragmatic and not prone to change quickly. She often appears tired -- however, that might be misleading, she is usually quite aware of what's going on. With a mere 1.62 meters, she is rather small.

It is now bound to a sewage cleaning vehicle employed by the [[St Petersburg Sewage and Waste Authority]]. It preys on anything smaller than itself in the Sewers, and claims them as its hunting ground, actively resisting other Steel Predators that would try to occupy it.

For these favours, the Prince helped the pack with the rite to cleanse the [[Great Slimy One|Great Slimy One's]] locus, providing five lesser Gafflings that would be destroyed in the process. The bargaining only implied that these favours have to at least theoretically be possible for the pack to achieve.

One of the five favours was [[The fate of The Bleeding Stone|called in]] recently, giving the pack the opportunity to get free of all of them - which they chose not to do.

Also semi part of this court is the locus in the pack's territory, in [[Angus]]' living area. A [[Heimeligkeitsfenster|locus of Hearth and Homeliness]], where hobos meet and can warm themselves. Due to the dual nature of home, fire and buildings, this is future battleground. The pack has secured right of passage in the Hearth locus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5163">====Overview====
The [[Shadowclaws|pack's]] territory is in St. Petersburg, in the district of Admiralitetsky. It consists mainly of low-income residential areas and a few larger industrial complexes. The territory claimed by the pack is marked in red, with the area de facto belonging to the [[Spirits of Fire and Steel]] marked by a dotted line.
[[image:Territory.jpg|frame|center|A Map of the Territory]]

====Industrial areas====

Industrial areas are coloured red.

[[Drnaya Steel Works]] and [[Asovitch Rohrbau]] are both large heavy-industry steel works that employ many people in the area. They are both not doing to well, and Asovitch Rohrbau has recently been hit by conflict with the mafia when they were involved in a [[fight in the sewers|waste disposal scandal]]. In the Hisil, they are home to the [[Spirits of Fire and Steel]] court. 

====Commercial areas====

Commercial areas are coloured yellow.

There is a small commercial area in the southwest of the territory, located between Asovitch Rohrbau and Drnaya Steel Works. The sports club (&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''I'''&lt;/span&gt;) where [[Grigor]] and [[Angus]] give their courses -- 'self-confidence through self-defence' and 'meditation and yoga for everyone', respectively -- is located in this area, as well as the administrations of the two large companies. There is also a [[Spartak cinema|cinema]] (&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''H'''&lt;/span&gt;) in this region, where Angus and his new-founded [[Cinema club]] regularly visit and a lot of the youths of the area meet.

The [[Admiralteyski Police Department|police department]] for western Admiralteyski is located in the center north. The local head of police is since more than a decade -- with a brief interlude -- [[Nievo Ashkov]]. The police department is still trying to recover from the [[Fight in the sewers|recent]] [[Battle against Rote Wut|events]] and the raid carried out by Grigor and [[Aleksandr]] to free [[Ivana]].

====Residential areas====

Residential areas make up by far the majority of the pack's territory and are coloured blue. The darker the blue, the poorer the area.

In the south and to the west between the factories are run-down areas, with many shabby and half-destroyed buildings, especially in the west. Angus lives here (&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''A'''&lt;/span&gt;; voluntarily, even). There are some pot plants in front of his home, which he needs to exchange every few days. A [[Locus]], the [[Heimeligkeitsfenster]] (&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;'''A'''&lt;/span&gt;), is also located in the basement of a destroyed building in this area. Next to the river, at the site of a former theater, is a [[garbage-burning facility]] responsible for the bad air and the lack of rebuilding programs in these parts.

The poor area to the south houses the pack's main [[old radio|locus]] (&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;'''B'''&lt;/span&gt;) in the building of the [[St Petersburg Sewage and Waste Authority]], Angus' workplace. The area contains [[Black locus|another small locus]] (&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;'''C'''&lt;/span&gt;) in a small chapel. This area is home to a poor immigrant community, mostly Finns and Ukranians.

In the center are low-income houses, mostly belonging to workers in the two factories or clerks from the factories' administrations. Some also have their own small shops, mostly in the southwest. The other pack members, Grigor (&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''B'''&lt;/span&gt;), [[Edouard Lambert|Edouard]] (&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''C'''&lt;/span&gt;), [[Grigori]] (&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''G'''&lt;/span&gt;) and [[Aleksandr]] (&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''D'''&lt;/span&gt;) live here. The infamous [[Bar Strocic|Bar Stroćic]] (&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''E'''&lt;/span&gt;) is located in this area, as well as the largest cinema in the area.

In the east is a [[Breeding Grounds|newly acquired]] residential area. Mostly middle-class shop-owners and employees live here, along with some upper middle-class businessmen. The [[St. Nicholaus Cathedral]] (&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;'''C'''&lt;/span&gt;) is in this part of the city, as is [[The Petersburg Night Cafe]] (&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''F'''&lt;/span&gt;). Under the cathedral is [[old altar|another locus]], but the area sorrounding it is still swarming with Rahglu and thus very dangerous. There is an ongoing conflict over property in a large part of the area, where the original deeds of the houses where lost (and recovered, but not yet published, by the Shadowclaws). Other problems are crime, especially in the southern area, and the Night Cafe with its far too late opening hours. The [[Neighbours for Neighbours]] operate in this area.

====Famous Landmarks====
The only famous landmarks in the pack's territory is the aforementioned St. Nicholaus Cathedral. It is sorrounded by a small park. Sadly, due to remains of an infestation by [[Rahglu]], the park is everything but safe at night.

Only a short distance from the pack's borders is the [[Saint Isaac Cathedral]] (&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;'''A'''&lt;/span&gt;) and the [[Bronze Horseman]] (&lt;span style=&quot;color:blue&quot;&gt;'''B'''&lt;/span&gt;), a large and very famous statue of the city's founder, Peter the Great.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5698">'''Disclaimer: Right now, this is pretty much work in progress. I want to turn it into a Werewolf Main Page, but I'm too lazy right now to think about how much text should go here. Input is welcome (see talk page).'''

This part of the Wiki is about the Werewolf: The Forsaken saga started in Konstanz. As the amount of material has grown considerably (and is still growing thanks to the Veteran Meetings), it merits its own 'main page' as a starting point for reading up ahead of a Veteran Meeting. That's what this page is about.

We now have a [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7kJRGPgvRQ title song] for Werewolf!

===Setting===

The saga is set in [[Petersburg|St Petersburg]], centred on a [[Shadowclaws|Pack of Werewolves]] holding a territory in the Admiralteyski district. The center of the town is in the hands of Forsaken, and they have formed a loose [[alliance]] to fend off the Pure waiting outside town. Four other packs of the alliance are known to the players: [[Schatten der Zaren]], [[Glasfelle]], [[Litanei der Straßen]] and [[Crimson Tears]]. With the execption of the recently formed last pack, there have been surprisingly few tensions among the alliance so far.

Information concerning the Setting is gathered in the [[:Category:Setting|Setting]] Category, with an overview being provided on the [[Petersburg]] page.

The [[locus|loci]] in the city are listed in the [[:Category:Locus|locus]] category.

The pack's Ithaeur also tries to complete a work on all of the spirits in the pack's territory. For a list, see [[:Category:Angus' Spirit Almanac|Angus' Spirit Almanac]]. For an overview, see the [[Spirits]] page.

===Dramatis Personae===

The center of the saga is of course the pack of player characters, going by the name of [[Shadowclaws]] and consisting of five Uratha. There are two - quite different - Cahalith, but the auspice role of Elodoth is unavailable, so the pack has troubles finding a balanced and mediated approach to problems (and life). While this has improved with the addition of the second Cahalith, the pack still has a tendency to create more problems than they solve.

Some of the other werewolves in the area have frequent contact with the pack, most often as mentors or teachers, in particular [[Victor Flammendes-Schwert]], the oldest werewolf and widely respected as an Elodoth and [[Andrei Wind-in-den-Straßen]], an experienced Ithaeur who taught Angus most of his rituals.

Other werewolves have occured as enemies in the past, but most of them are dead. [[Die Amazone]] was also an enemy of the pack, then turned almost an ally. She is now dead. 

There is a number of important mortal that often make an appearance, namely [[Nievo Ashkov]], the local head of police; [[Nadja Ivanetsch]], Angus' wolf-blooded girlfriend; [[Ivana]], a colleague of Aleksandr and [[Vladimir Wecek]], the mafia boss of Grigor.

Information on the characters is gathered in the [[:Category:Characters|Characters]] Category. There is a roughly sorted overview on the [[Dramatis Personae]] page. Spirits and other denizens of the Hisil are listed on the [[spirits]] page and gathered in [[:Category:Angus' Spirit Almanac|Angus' Spirit Almanac]].

===Territory===

The Territory of the characters lies in the southwest of the city center, in Admiralteisky district. It is mostly compromised of industrial areas and the residential areas of the workers. To the west is the baltic sea, and to the east the old city center, most of it still no-mans-land. To the north and south lie the territories of other packs, both members of the alliance.

The mood in the territory is mostly gloomy, as the prospects of the working populace are not the best. The pack has started some initiatives to try and brighten up the district, but up to now they only (if at all) set off the problems caused by the pack in its fight against supernatural enemies.

The spirit side of the territory is correspondingly dangerous, with the west being in the firm grip of the (quite xenophobic) [[Spirits of Fire and Steel|Court of Fire and Steel]], and the rest more or less under control of the gloomy ones, with some isolated pockets belonging to other courts.

Locations important to the territory - and its history - are listed under [[:Category:Territory|Category:Territory]], with an overview on the [[Territory]] page.

===History of the Pack===

The pack claimed its territory about a year ago. Initially, the young werewolves had a lot of difficulties, upsetting human and spirit population alike with their behaviour. While this has improved over the year, there still is a long way to go.

After the [[Old radio|conquest of a locus]], the pack was busy fending off attacks by several spirits in the area, all of them not pleased by the arrival of a self-proclaimed 'gauntlet police'. Only recently were they able to establish themselves, finally gaining some sort of control over the hisil as well.

There are still a lot of enemy factions, though, and the pack had to prove itself once more as the conflict with the [[Violent Ones]] [[The fate of The Bleeding Stone|rose to a new peak]] over the allegiance of a powerful spirit. In the end, they were able to fend off the attack. Most likely, they only won a bit of breathing space, as the Court seems far from being beaten.

The [[:Category:Tales|tales]] category contains all pages about the history of the pack. The [[timeline]] pages provides an overview.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2828">====Botches====

Rolling at least 50% 1s on a roll ''without a single success'' is a critical failure. 

====Renown XP====

Renown XP is doled out by the storyteller for specific actions and cannot be bought using regular XP. 

====Languages====

A score of * in a language allows everyday conversation, and sufficient reading/writing to get along. A score of ** allows full fluency, at a level of a native speaker, yet with a (possibly slight) accent that tells listeners you're a non-native speaker. A score of *** allows for the active use of different dialects, full command of the language and an extensive vocabulary. With this level it is possible to fool almost all people into believing you are a native speaker. Most native speakers do not have this level of proficiency.

====Damage and Wound Penalties====

The first health box is always without penalty. The last ''two'' health boxes are at -3, the two before that at -2 penalty. All remaining health boxes are at -1 penalty. The number of these boxes depends on the total number of health boxes available.

====Claws and Teeth Damage====

Werewolves in Gauru form get +2(L) claws damage and +3(L) bite damage. Urshul claws do +0(L) damage, Urhan +0(B). Both Urshul's and Urhan's bite attacks are at +1(L). 

====Rite of Contrition====

This Rite is a level 1 rite, but may only be used personally. It can not be performed on someone else's behalf. (The Book was unclear on the second part)

====Rite of the Chosen Ground====

This rite no longer requires a locus, it can also be performed with other objects as focal point. If the focal point is not a locus, the following restrictions apply:

* The object must have a spirit of at least Greater Gaffling rank, which has to cooperate throughout the rite
* The spirit (and object) must be aligned with the kind of resonance sought (e.g., a white flag for &quot;peacefulness&quot; or &quot;french&quot;)
* The area affected spreads out from the object with the same radius that a locus of equal rank to the spirit would have (i.e., two yards for a lesser gaffling, 15 for a greater gaffling, up to a city block for a minor god). There is no factor of 3, as the &quot;boost&quot; from the locus is lacking

====Loci====

A locus can not be 'sucked dry' - that is just too simple a way of destroying it. As soon as the stored essence runs out, no more can be extracted.

====Helping Another====

Instead of rolling when aiding another, the recipient gains a flat number of bonus dice equal to 1/3 the dice of his aide (rounded real). You can not help another if you do not possess the fitting skill (even if you have Int 6, without Crafts you're not going to be any help repairing a motorcycle).

====Wolf Fighting Styles, Pack Tactics====

See the [[Pack Tactics, Tactical Combats and Complexity]] page.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1812">A pack of werewolves who claim their territory to the north of the Shadowclaws. Part of the [[alliance]] of werewolves in central St. Petersburg.

&quot;Litanei der Straßen&quot; is probably a more typical pack of werewolves. They largely mind their own business, resent any interference by outsiders and protect their territory fiercely. They have a certain esoteric touch, and it is not known what their pack totem is. In fact little is known about the pack beside its members and its very territorial nature - except that they keep their territory clean and that it is supposedly very unhealthy to enter it unannounced.

&quot;Litanei der Straßen&quot; has had little dealings with the [[Shadowclaws]], partially because of their reclusiveness, but also because their territories do not border. Only Yelena and [[Grigor]] have met at times, due to their common [[Bear Hunters|lodge]] - the [[Enlightened]] members of the pack regularly attend the (rare) meetings of the lodge, but neither had much talk with [[Angus]] outside of that.

Victor looks like he is in his late sixties - for a werewolf, that could mean his age is anything up to eighty. He is usually wearing a suit, although nothing too fashionable. On werewolf-only occasions, he usually carries his two-handed sword with him. The sword is not really burning, but it reflects light in a very bright, vivid orange forming strange patterns.

The pack later  ..found out she was also a member of the gang they wiped out to gain access to their [[Old radio|locus]] -- all in all, [[Grigor]] killed three of her boyfriends in short order, each time killing her &quot;family&quot; again. [[Angus]] believes she is wolf-blooded.

After recent events, she hooked up with Angus, and send [[Angus sending a messenger to Nadja's grandfather|a message]] to her grandfather, giving a few detail about how getting involved with the [[Shadowclaws]] turned out for her. She was given a ''Rabbit's Foot'' Talen by Angus, so that she can always contact him should the need arise. 

== Description ==

Nadja is a wiry woman in her late twenties. Her brown, shoulder-long hair is usually uncombed, while her blue eyes seem to be restlessly scanning her surroundings. With a height of 1.73 meters and her everyday clothes she never sticks out in a crowd. On a closer look, she displays some small scars, marks of a violent past.

He is part of a gang from the hiphop milieu that regularly shows up at Grigor's boxing sessions - although Josuv only came along once and didn't join them since. The first time he was there, he lost his nerve, attacking his training partner. When Grigor stopped him, he went crazy and ran out of the building. The pack had little time to find him since, so he is presumably somewhere out there. His father was contacted (after a small &quot;misunderstanding&quot;) in an effort to find the boy.

====Description==== 

Josuv is a inconspicuous seventeen-year-old. He is sometimes the victim of childish mockery due to his smooth face and his long brown hair -- though that usually ends soon, since Josuv is prone to losing his temper. He's usually dressed in oversized clothing and a cap depicting the emblem of the St. Petersburg ice hockey club.

As the other werewolves regularly state they prefer it that way, this is not likely to change any time soon. Vladimir is the mafia contact of Grigor, the one who tells him what his superiors want and the one to go to if something wrong is going on. Vladimir and Grigor usually meet in a small restaurant, where the salad is unusually good. At least, Grigor always only eats salad.

====Description====

Vladimir looks like the common guy on the street -- that might be the best description of him. Wearing a grey pullover, an old coat and jeans, it is easy to miss him in the streets even if you know how he looks. His face has no distinct features except for a stern look.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2148">'Glasfelle' is a pack of werewolves living to the east of the [[Shadowclaws]]. They are also part of the [[alliance]]. This pack is the most 'friendly' of the neighbours the Shadowclaws have, and especially their Iron Masters maintain good ties with the players. Shuro has also been of help at times, though he usually is not very forthcoming with advice, preferring for the Shadowclaws to solve problems themselves.

The 'Glasfelle' are dominated by Iron Master ideology: They take a very modern approach to maintaining a territory. Since two of their three members are also in the [[Shepherds|Lodge of Shepherds]], they have very good contact with the humans in their territory. Andrei is the alpha of the pack (and the leader of the shepherds), though it seems that most decisions are made by the member first encountering them and then accepted by the pack.

Other packs watch the modern approach of the Glasfelle with disapproval, but it appears to be working well. Their territory matches that of most other packs in size - yet there are only three of them. Shuro seems to do most of the fighting, and the spirits tell many tales about his legendary skills in combat. It is noteworthy that no werewolves outside the pack have seen him fight yet, though.

The pack's totem, called &quot;Ubuntu&quot;, is a spirit of community. It helps the two Shepherds understand the humans in their territory even better, and seems to enable the pack to communicate over longer distances.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2323">&quot;Schatten der Zaren&quot; is a pack of werewolves living to the north of the [[Shadowclaws]]. Their territory is centred on the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Paul_fortress Peter and Paul fortress.] Some members of the pack are among the oldest werewolves in the city. The pack is also the centre of the loose [[alliance]] of werewolves in St. Petersburg, as the 'High Judge' is their alpha.

&quot;Schatten der Zaren&quot; claims the largest Forsaken territory in the City, extending a good part to the north and west of their stronghold. As a blessed pack, with many members of high renown rank, and due to their leader being High Judge, they are somewhat the &quot;alpha pack of packs&quot;, though they never make their leading role explicit so as not to stir up trouble. They keep to themselves, but are willing to offer advice if sought out on proper terms.

They often used to function as mentors for the young werewolves of the Shadowclaws, but this has largely ceased since the Shadowclaws have started expanding their territory and showing that they can stand on their own feet (and claws).

The [[Window-to-the-West|totem]] of &quot;Schatten der Zaren&quot; is rumoured to be an old spirit of learning, though little is known about it. The pack is highly protetive of their totem and its identity.

She is very stern and has a short temper, leading her pack with an iron fist. She honours the [[alliance]], though she always makes it perfectly clear that any violations of the territory of her pack will be met with lethal force.

Her pack members seem to hold her in very high regard, which is probably a consquence of her always leading from the front. She prefers to fight in Urshul form.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1536">The werewolves in central St. Petersburg have formed a loose alliance. As usual among werewolves, the term 'alliance' has to be treated with care: All that is asked is that the packs let the 'high jugde' of the alliance settle territorial conflicts among them before they get out of hand. Some werewolves, especially those of the [[Enlightened]] Lodge of the Storm Lords, feel that even more cooperation would be preferable. However, they admit that even this small alliance is something to be treasured, given the nature of werewolves.

The reason most packs join the alliance is that St. Petersburg was in the hands of the Pure until a few years ago, when a joint effort - led by [[Victor Flammendes-Schwert]] - of the Forsaken drove them out of the city. Now, they are in the outskirts and in the wilderness to the east, constantly trying to take the city back from the Forsaken. Rumour has it that the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Paul_fortress Peter and Paul fortress] contains a powerful locus home to a spirit of immense value to werewolves, but the pack holding the territory ([[Schatten der Zaren]]) does not reveal what exactly it is. Other rumour says that all members of the Enlightened Lodge are privy to those secrets, but sworn to not even share them with their pack.

Whatever resides there, the Pure want it badly, and as they outnumber the Forsaken, the packs of the alliance cannot let infighting weaken them too much or else the Pure will strike a killing blow.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1472">''&quot;Your herd is your territory. Your territory is your herd. As a shepherd you watch over them, known, but not recognized.&quot;''

The [[lodge]] of Shepherds is one of the Iron Master Lodges that are present in the area of St. Petersburg. Its members are spread all over Europe and Russia. The emphasis of the lodge of Shepherds is understanding the humans in your territory -- what drives them, what do they fear, what do they long for? As humans are the most prominent source of essence, a deep understanding of the human part of your territory can make managing the Hisil a lot easier.

It is known that the Shepherds possess some rituals and fetishes that help them stay in touch with their herd. No precise details are known outside the lodge, though. The Shepherds also seem to value social skills highly and have little problem learning them from each other.

The Shepherds [[Lodge Initiations#Edouard's Lodge Initiation|take in]] any Iron Masters that turn up. Initiates gain a mentor, often [[Andrei Wind-in-den-Straßen|Andrej]] himself, represented by the merit Mentor 1. They are then told to show they can understand humanity, and that they need not make too much of an effort - the lodge will know when they are ready.

After working his way into the social elite and gaining access to the sponsors of Neighbours for Neighbours, Edouard was [[Charity Dinner|accepted]] into the lodge by his mentor [[Vanka Iosiforna]].

It can keep you warm at night, or it can strike you down as a thunderbolt from an unseen direction.&quot;''

The [[lodge]] of Lightning is a community of Iron Masters all around the world, who dedicate themselves to understanding the impact modern technology has made on the lives of the werewolves and the duty of the Forsaken. For a long time, technological progress was slow to non-existent, but in the last two centuries almost everything has changed. This does not only affect the lives of humans - it also has vast consequences for the spirit world, especially in the cities of the modern world. Understanding these consequences is of the utmost importance if one wants to keep the inhabitants of a city's Hisil on their side of the gauntlet.

Werewolves of the lodge of Lightning have a good understanding of modern technology, and are known to teach those skills among themselves. They are rumoured to possess gifts from spirits most other werewolves haven't even heard about yet.

[[Aleksandr]] has applied for the lodge, leading to a very uncommon [[Disco Fever|night out]].

It was Fenris-Ur who said he would accept only those who could bathe their talons in the blood of a true god. This is what we stand for. To truly reach your full potential in combat, you must strive for this one goal Fenris-Ur gave us.&quot;''

The [[lodge]] of Blood Seekers is a loose association of Blood Talons around the world, who share one common philosophy: To be a warrior means to constantly seek greater challenges, stronger foes to best. Some packs value a Blood Seeker member for his contribution to the overall fighting strength of the pack, while others - especially those preferring a less direct approach - seem hesitant to accept someone in their ranks whose highest goal in life is combat. The Blood Seekers are often seen as the cliché of a Blood Talon, warriors who care for little else but the thrill of melee - yet noone who ever witnessed a Blood Seeker in battle can deny that some of them might truly have reached their goal: The Blood Seekers are hands down the best fighters among the Uratha in single combat. It is, after all, what they live for. 

Blood Seekers constantly seek stronger enemies against which they can measure themselves, and it is said that they possess strange Gifts that allow them to find their foes, and to push their fighting prowess to a point where they actually can take on stronger foes with a hope of success.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2883">''&quot;Since time immemorial, we hunt. And since then, we have used our numbers as a tactic to overcome superior foes. The fact that we still do so today is more than proof for the effectiveness of a pack against unorganised foes. It is the essence of our existence. To be a Bear Hunter means to live in the oldest tradition of warriors on earth.&quot;''

The Bear Hunters are a very ancient [[lodge]] of Blood Talons in the area of Scandinavia and northern Russia, with traditions reaching back to the warrior tribes that inhabited the area during the stone age and earlier. They emphasise working together to achieve a goal, true to the saying 'the sum is greater than its parts'. While the Bear Hunters are usually fierce warriors, they acknowledge that combat is only the last step of a successful hunt. A good group of warriors employing pack tactics will often have won before actual fighting takes place, simply by stacking the odds high enough in their favour. The Bear Hunters are very proud of their old roots, and claim that many of their traditions and ceremonies have not changed in ten thousand years.  
Bear Hunters are usually highly valued pack members, as they raise the efficiency of the entire pack while on the hunt. Packs consisting entirely of Bear Hunters are a part of local werewolf legends, and usually credited with feats that would be considered impossible for their numbers.

Bear Hunters are known to provide various advantages to their pack members, employing tactics learned at the regular gatherings of the lodge. Only few of these tactics involve direct combat - many deal with preparing the battle ground and steering the prey into a position where it can neither escape nor properly defend itself.

The Bear Hunters are a very proud tribe, and they would never allow outsiders to jugde themselves if they are ready to join the lodge. Therefore, it is impossible to ask for membership - one has to receive an invitation from within the lodge. That being sad, there are [[Lodge Initiations#Grigor's Lodge Initiation|ways]] to expedite such an invitation.

The lodge regularly meets for set traditional occasions, often to [[The hunt at Autumn Equinox|hunt]] together.


Mechanical Benefits: Initiates of the Bear Hunters gain the Mentor merit at one dot, as they are given an older member to help in their integration process (and judge their progress).

Members of the Bear Hunters can learn the Pack Tactics merit as well as one Fighting Style (their choice) at reduced cost, due to the constant training in team combat. They also pay one dot less for the Socialize skill, as they are more used to company than many other werewolves. Lastly, they have access to some talens that the lodge produces at its regular gatherings. Members can expect to be provided with roughly one talen per year from these meetings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2346">== Outset ==

To be able to receive more foreign money, the St Petersburg city hall opened a branch concerned with environmental safety and other issues dear to a western European's heart. A frenchman was appointed to lead the branch, [[Maurice Gerald]]. A building for the environmental branch was opened in the pack's [[territory]]. The building was scouted out by [[Grigori]], who, then an employer of the city, had the task to find a suitable building. He wrote the reports clearly favouring the building for a reason - in fact, the pack's main [[locus]] lies in the building. 

== Founding ==

At first, [[Grigori]] decided to transfer from his job as a lockkeeper to the Sewage and Waste Authority, so that the pack would have easier access to the locus. [[Angus]] then followed and started work as an office bitch. After Grigori left, a chemist, [[Andrei Andreiovich]] joined the team. The first major task was the [[Fight in the sewers|investigation]] of a waste disposal scandal, which let to very high pollution levels in the waters leaving the sewers. Angus was tasked with mapping out most of the sewers, since decades of neglect had led to cave-ins, rusted locks, and maps that were far from accurate.

== Destruction and Rebuilding ==

Following the events of [[Battle against Rote Wut|the infiltration of the Rote Wut]], Gerald and the chemist were found dead in the burned-out office. Angus became acting chief of the division and oversees the rebuilding and reorganisation of the branch. 

Renovation of the building took about a month and ate into the funds of the branch. The recent acquisition of a special robot for better access of the sewers, part of a deal with [[Steel Spider]], means there are unlikely to be any further expansions this year. In particular, it seems Angus will have to do the job alone, since there is no money for another employee.

== Current state ==

Currently, the branch headed by Angus has a small motorboat and some measuring instruments at its disposal, as well as a special robot designed to access smaller pipes, collecting samples and helping to map the sewer system. Much of the laboratory part needed for detailed chemical analysis was lost in the fire, and has not yet been replaced - and probably won't be before the new 2003 budget arrives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1365">A bar run by the mafia in the [[territory]] of the pack. Before [[Grigor]] rose in the ranks of the mafia, he was a bouncer here. There is a back room and a basement where not even Grigor had access to. Regularly, limousines would bring men to the bar, who would enter the back room(s). Due to the very unpleasant spirit landscape at this bar, speculation runs wild as to just what terrible things might be taking place in the basement. Child prostitution? Torture? Human trafficking? Trade in some horrible drugs?

The wild speculations as to the nature of the 'business' conducted here were [[The fate of The Bleeding Stone|recently]] given new fuel, when the pack discovered a distinct tatoo on the body of a ridden that had created no end of trouble for them. Grigor instantly recognised it: It grants free access to Bar Strocic.

The discovery of such a mark of entry on the body of a ridden lawyer, well-established in the city, and associated with criminal elements and violent spirits, is shocking in itself, but there is something even worse: The pack easily recalls that the Mafia backed away from Grigor and refused to help when it became clear he was at odds with The Lawyer. If even the Mafia doesn't want to anger whatever was behind the agency, it probably isn't a wise idea.

Or, more precisely, wasn't.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="923">Grigori Timoschenko was born in 1980 in the city of Omsk. His father held a position as engineer in the Russian defence industry, his mother was an actress. At the age of about ten, Grigori's family moved to the town of Jakutsk. This turned out to be a cut in his life. He didn't get along very well with his new environment and became a kind of loner. He found great comfort, though, in the Siberian storytelling of his girlfriend Lena's grandparents. The passion for these stories never left him and carried him through his studies of civil engineering in Ufa. He was lucky to find a job where he could have his peace, as head of the night shift at St Petersburg's lock 17. He gave up this position in favour of a position close to the pack's locus, though he's probably less into pack discipline and definitely not into tribe discipline. Frequently uses the word &quot;fascist&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2988">The packs main Locus is situated in an old building in the southeast of their territory. Both the Locus and the building have seen quite some action since the pack moved into this area.

The Locus, at the moment manifested in a computer, is aligned with 'information'. It seems that during the Siege of the City, one of the few working radios was in this room, where family, friends and neighbours all would gather to catch up on how the war was progressing (or, at least, how the Soviet press claimed it was progressing). The essence lingering in the area finally formed a locus, which manifested in the radio. The building served as a workshop for car repairs on the lower floor, while the family lived on the upper floor.

In the nineties, there was a downward trend in the area, and the workshop was closed. The building soon afterwards became home to a local gang, which occupied it until recently.

When the pack found out about the locus, not only did they face the problem of somehow removing or convincing the gang. As it turned out, a not too kind spirit made of shadows and despair, commanding a smaller spirit court, had claimed the locus its own. The young werewolfs learned the hard way just how unwelcome they were in the Hisil.

The mundane site of the problem was easily dealt with: The packs [[Aleksandr|Irraka]] infiltrated the building one night and silently took out the head of the gang. Next evening, the pack attacked the now leaderless gang and more or less wiped them out.
Only a few weeks later, the building was claimed for the newly-founded [[St Petersburg Sewage and Waste Authority]] in the area, with both [[Grigori]] and [[Angus]] as employees.

As it turned out, the spirit side was not quite as easily dealt with. After a crushing defeat at the hands of their enemy that almost cost [[Grigor]] his life, the pack went out to search for a weak spot of their enemy. They learned the spirits ban and fashioned a weapon to exploit it. Even then, their Cahalith warned them against a frontal assault, so they made a deal with a movie theatre and laid a trap for their enemy.

After honouring their side of the deal - hunting down a rogue spirit that had escaped into the mundane world - they arranged for a blackout during the premiere of the newest movie, generating a large amount of darkness-affiliated essence. As predicted, their enemy could not resist such a meal and showed up with only a light escort. The trap was sprung, and the pack charged their enemies as one. The fighting was fierce, but the weapon fashioned against the spirits ban gave their Rahu the decisive edge in the struggle, and this time he came out on top.

The locus was now the packs to command, and they quickly entered an agreement with a few information-spirits called [[EepEep]]s that resided there. This agreement stands to this day, even though it was almost cancelled during the infiltration by [[Rote Wut]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="682">There is a big locus in the sewers of Admiralteyski. It has been the place of the pack's fight against the [[Great Slimy One]]. It is not known if this locus existed before the coming of the waste spirit, or if both were in fact created by the [[fight in the sewers|disposal of hazardous waste into the sewers]]. The locus was aligned to fresh water by a complicated ritual performed by [[Angus]], and is now fiercely contested by the sewers spirit population. The pack has kept out of the fighting for the time being, content that the spirits are busy with one another and no threat to their territory at the moment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1349">A bit to the southwest of the packs main locus, in the same shabby housing area, is another, smaller locus. When the pack first moved in, this locus was attuned to depression, decay and hopelessness. It was here that the young, inexperienced werewolves were almost annihilated when they were ambushed by the spirit that claimed the locus. In the following struggle, the werewolves were able to beat their opponent with the help of the [[Spirits of Fire and Steel]] and a special weapon exploiting the spirit's ban. The locus, as was a condition for the aid of the powerful court, was destroyed in the process, and lay dormant for quite a while.

When [[She-Who-Was-Eternally-Lost]] escaped from the [[Roter Hof|red court]], she was drawn to the area of the locus. After her deal with the pack exempt her from prosecution by the werewolves, she began to settle in and form a powerbase of her own. The locus has since reappeared a few meters further, inside a small orthodox chapel (the locus' physical manifestation is the crucifix at the wall behind the altar). It seems to be attuned to feelings of loss, and the fear associated with them. The air in the building is correspondingly gloomy, yet many of the locals go here to pray for lost loved ones, or to be alone with their grief.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6873">'''Name:''' Grigor Yaschenko

'''Nationality:''' Russian

'''Age:''' 24

'''Place of Birth:''' Moscow

'''Previous Occupation:''' Boxer / Mafia errand-boy

'''Auspice:''' Rahu (Full Moon)

'''Tribe:''' Blood Talons

'''Lodge:''' [[Bear Hunters]]

'''Initial Appearance'''

Grigor is of average height and quite lean, but keeps himself
in good physical shape, and is fairly muscular. He has black hair
which he keeps either very short or completely shaved, giving him a
bit of a mean look. Typical clothing: T-shirt and jeans, and a black
leather jacket.

'''Current Appearance'''

Since his First Change, Grigor's increasing physical strength has become a little
harder to hide. He has already acquired a fair number of battle scars, some
of them from life-threatening wounds. Increasingly, Grigor pays scant
attention to his clothing and general appearance - he finds that most
people keep out of his way regardless. On his right arm he has begun to
tattoo a representation of each of the major foes he has defeated, and on
his (weaker) left arm, a representation of all of the innocent victims of
his rage, which are sadly at least as numerous. Typically seen smoking a
dirty-looking cigarette which emits a foul and suspicious stench. (These
&quot;custom&quot; cigarettes are in fact soaked in the blood of various persons/victims,
which Grigor has begun to collect.)

'''Background'''

Grigor was born in a poor suburb of Moscow and grew accustomed to
hardship and criminality from an early age. His mother was a
prostitute and his father died of a traffic accident (supposedly)
when he was 9. His mother was always a bit distant, and he soon
dropped out of school and fell in with a local gang, learning how
to fight for himself. At the age of 16 he started running errands
for the local small-time crime baron (part of the so-called
Russian Mafia). He also joined a gym and started to learn how to
box. From hints dropped by people in the local Mafia, he later
discovered that his father had also been a member, and he began
to suspect that his death was not so accidental after all...

At the age of 19 he was arrested for possession of narcotics
(a job he was doing). He wisely did not betray his superiors, but
this meant he was sent to prison. He was released two years later,
at the age of 21. Working for the Mafia in Moscow seemed trickier with
a criminal record, and besides, he wanted to get away from there, his
mum, and his past. He was given a contact in St. Petersburg and moved
there, starting with a few simple jobs for a local crime lord. (For
example, acting as a bodyguard or driver, being sent round to threaten
someone or beat them up, that kind of thing.)

However, Grigor tried not to involve himself too heavily in crime -
only doing the minimum necessary to make ends meet. (He didn't want
to end up like his father.) His real ambition was boxing, and to
become a professional boxer. He was pretty good, and in a couple of
years he had won a half-dozen amateur middleweight fights, and was on
the threshold of becoming a pro. The local boss had supported him up
to this point... He only needed to win one more easy fight, before he
would get a shot at fighting a big name. This was when the boss
ordered him to &quot;take a fall.&quot; The idea is to deliberately and
unexpectedly lose against a weaker opponent with long odds - and for
the Mafia to make a load of money by betting correctly on the fight.
Grigor strongly wanted to disobey his superiors, but it would have
been suicide - so he gritted his teeth and took the fall, and with it
his dreams of professional boxing were more or less over, for which
he'll never forgive the boss...

'''Grigor as a Werewolf'''

From the beginning, Grigor's role in the pack was clear. At least at that
time, he was the only one who could fight worth a damn. Unfortunately for
the pack, however, its best fighter was also its most prone to fury.
At least in the early days, Grigor would invariably &quot;lose it&quot; at some point
in the battle, not resting until anyone or anything - friend or foe - had been
torn apart. Needless to say, this caused some considerable unrest, both among
the pack and in the spirit world. When Grigor enters Death Rage, he is not so
easy to stop! One time, after going off on a bender in the spirit world, Grigor
very nearly didn't come back alive.

Grigor quickly worked to establish the pack's authority in their territory,
through the straightfoward scheme of annihilating any rival gangs.
Unfortunately, as usual, he was a little too overenthusiastic and hot-headed...
Rumours still persist of a prolific and perverted mass murderer in the local
area, and both the police and the mafia are keen to see this menace removed.

Grigor has struggled to get his tendency to rage under control, successfully
at times. But he is still liable to go off at any time!

Grigor currently works for the local mafia under the direction of [[Vladimir Wecek]].
He also teaches a course entitled &quot;Self-Confidence through Self-Defense&quot; at the
local sports club, which is popular among the disaffected youth.

High point: Defeating the [[Great Slimy One]] in one-on-one combat.

Low point: Slaying the werewolf Stahlknochen of the [[Rote Wut]] to the south, and
wisely taking his head home as a trophy. Diplomacy was never his strong suit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7932">====Intro: Theatre Spirits on the Loose====

About a month after the [[battle against Rote Wut]] ended and things finally settled down a bit in the territory, the pack encountered strange phenomena in the space of a few hours. While [[Aleksandr]] encountered people dancing in the streets, [[Grigor]] was stopped and attacked by Robin Hood impersonators. Repeatedly, members of the pack encountered people blocking the entrance to houses and demanding obscure riddles to be solved before letting people pass.

These events coincided with the arrival of [[Grigori]], returning from a long voyage through Siberia with a warning: in his dreams, the pack solved a lesser problem by killing it and only thus paved the way for an even greater problem to arrive. The pack met at Grigor's place and, while exchanging recent news, decided that quick action was needed in response to the day's events.

[[Angus]] and [[Edouard Lambert|Edouard]] went to talk to the [[Cinema Spirit]] the pack already knew from their [[Conquest of the Locus|conquest of a locus]]. In exchange for a modicum of essence and the promise of Angus to revive the weekly [[cinema club]] he once attended, the spirit was willing to tell them that the dancing spirits were not necessarily 1950s style cinema spirits, but rather spirits that found an &quot;opportunity&quot;. The cinema spirit was unable to explain what an opportunity is, though.

====Act 1: An Opportunity for Spirits, a Burden for Werewolves====

Further investigations about the reason and nature of these events quickly linked the opportunity to rogue spirits being able to cross the gauntlet in great numbers. It was revealed that there had been an opportunity somewhere close to the [[garbage-burning facility]]. However, it was not possible to determine the exact nature of this opportunity. With some leg work by Grigor and [[Aleksandr]], the pack was able to find out that the place in question was a small cabaret club. There, a one-man show had been hosted the previous night, run by a complete [[Yorek &quot;Howl-from-beyond&quot;|stranger]] that did not bother to stay afterwards or even introduce himself. Everyone agreed that the show was especially good. 

While strange events linked to rogue spirits continued to rise, the pack tried to pin down this stranger and find a place where they would be able to watch the show -- and thus, the opportunity -- themselves. Using their contacts to their advantage the pack was able to locate the next show within two days, to be held at a local pub. It had already begun, and the location was overrun with people wanting to see his unique performance. 

Trying to enter through the back door, Angus was ambushed by three spirits of pain, which were quickly driven off after the rest of the pack arrived. Breaking down the back doors, the werewolves made their way through the pub's basement into the pub itself. They tried to find the man performing the shows -- or his granddaughter, who was organising them. The granddaughter turned out to be [[Nadja Ivanetsch|Nadja]], the presumed wolf-blooded the pack already knew from previous encounters. A shot suddenly fell and panic ensued. 

While Grigor and Aleksandr moved out to block the way to Nadja's car, Angus noticed that the old man seemed to be unperturbed and still acting, despite the mass of panicked people trying to squeeze out of the bar. Outside, Grigor spotted Nadja getting into the car and approached her with the intention of stopping her. A second shot rang, and things spiralled out of control. Grigor succumbed into Death Rage, as the (silver) bullet shot by Nadja burned its way through his flesh with supernatural force. Aleksandr almost lost his life holding back Grigor, helping Nadja make an escape with her car. In the ensuing chaos, both Nadja and her grandfather managed to escape.

====Act 2: A Burden for Werewolves, a Duty for Werewolves====

It did not take long for the pack to track Nadja down to her apartment. As the pack planned for her extraction, her grandfather again got away. After some investigation the werewolves managed to confront and capture Nadja, who could barely move with the heavy injuries suffered in escape from the scene of Grigor's carnage. They put her in Edouard's place and tried to get information about her grandfather out of her, although with little success.

The old man did not plan to evade them. He returned to the scene of his first play to give another performance. The pack was also present, and as the old man gave his play, Angus was able to see an increasing number of spirits crossing the gauntlet. The play was a number of dialogues held with the reflections in one of three mirrors. The pack moved to stop him, cutting the power to the stage and bar and starting to evacuate the attendents. It turned out the old man was actually a werewolf, though he was beyond normal madness. The interruption of his play seemed to almost destroy him, and he broke down into an incoherent babbling about something 'crossing the barrier'. As they had been warned by Grigori's dream not to kill him, they took him with them to Edouard's apartment. While the rest of the pack commenced to chase down the great number of rogue spirits plaguing the territory, Edouard and Grigori took turns in trying to get some information out of the old man. After two days of listening to his mad ramblings, they finally got the rough details -- the best that they could hope for. The mirror represented the entrance to a 'parallel version' of some Siberian castle, and a strange being of madness had started infiltrating the other side and threatened to break through into the mortal world. The parallel world was once simply the spirit reflection of the keep, and later transformed into a sort of 'pocket stronghold' by one of the castles' lords. By performing the stage show, the old man was able to generate enough essence to keep the natural defences of the parallel world active, thus preventing the strange being from breaking through. 

For the promise of expanding the packs control eastwards and lessening the territorial no-man's-land between them and the [[Glasfelle]] pack, Angus was able to obtain information on how to best resolve the problem. Obviously, it would not be possible to continue the stage rituals, as too many spirits were able to cross the border. More even, if this turned out to be a regular event. Instead, if the pack could make their way through to the heart of the parallel castle and take it back with them to the real world, the link between the mirror and the parallel world would be severed, denying the strange being its way into reality. Without hesitation, the pack gathered and embarked on the journey.

====Final: Inside the Castle of Dementia====

The castle was a weird place: the walls seemed to leak off into nothingness, sucking away the life energies of the werewolves. Strange spirits blocked their way, and the walls themselves formed arms and tentacles to lash out at the intruders. The floors and halls of the castle were ever-shifting and changing once the pack entered a new room. Finally, they found the centre, a red diamond resting in the hands of the statue of a priest, flanked by two stone knights. Obviously, the statues did not stay immobile long after the diamond was removed and the pack had to make a fighting retreat. It was here that Grigor made up for his earlier glitch, proving essential to the fight by reducing the priest statue to a pile of rubble and covering the retreat of his packmates. In the end, all packmembers made it out alive -- though for some it was a very close call.

Angus freed the powerful spirit bound into the diamond, and the old werewolf, finally free of the burden that had driven him insane, went off to spent his last years in Siberia, resuming the wanderings he had to interrupt so long ago when he first found the mirrors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="799">The western part of the pack's territory is occupied by Drnaya Steel Works. The factory consists of several parts, transforming scrap iron and raw materials to pipes, beams and other large steel constructs. The steelworks are one of the biggest employers in the area, and has considerable security. It is not known if it is involved with the mafia that runs a lot of the district's business. Work at the factory is harsh, and the low pay is one of the contributors to the general feelings of gloom and despair that are prevalent in the area.

Close to the part were the scrap iron is melted, there is also a [[garbage-burning facility]].

The Hisil side of the steelworks is in the firm grip of the [[Spirits of Fire and Steel|court of fire and steel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1664">Close to the [[Drnaya Steel Works]], but not on the grounds of the factory itself, is a relatively modern garbage-burning facility, providing some of the necessary energy for the factory in one of St. Petersburg's 'greener future' projects designed to increase the flow of foreign aid into the city. This facility is very controversial, as the fumes make living nearby quite unpleasant, and its location was formerly occupied by an old theatre held in high value by the local population. It was torn down without consulting the local populace, and its most famous actor reportedly killed himself over this - though urban legends report he was sighted since then, promoting acting and theatre plays in general.

On the Hisil, the scars of the transformation are even more visible. Since most of the humans in the area still think of the theatre rather than the annoying facility now occupying its place, the reflection is a weird mixture of both: The old theatre building, with smoke extruding from the broken windows, and numerous heaps of burning trash lying around. With some patience, it is possible to find older spirits stemming from the days of the theatre here. Even the newer spirits residing here seem to assume some aspect of theatre plays, which can make them quite annoying to deal with. Most spirits in this place claim allegiance to the [[Court of Eternal Grace]], though the court does not claim the area as its own. The place appears to have two spirits: [[Prince Yaromir]], representing the old theatre, and the spirit of the new garbage-burning facility, which seems to feed on culture and creativity.

      <comment>seems a lot of adventures hat this court involved ...</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1691">A [[spirits|spirit court]] concerned with the arts, culture and associated things. It is unclear how far exactly the domain of this court goes, but given that it is quite powerful and many of the old historical buildings also belong to it, it might even encompass nobility and similar cnocepts. The pack came into contact with the court during the events of [[the old werewolf's last play]]. Possibly, [[Prince Yaromir]] is a member of this court. Other likely members include the spirit known as [[Meister im Norden]] and [[the Bleeding Stone]]. [[Kaffeehaus]], the spirit of [[Café Alexanderplatz]], is a member of this court allied with the pack.

The court has a mixed history with the pack, acting as opponent during [[the old werewolf's last play]], as advisors during [[the fate of The Bleeding Stone]] and recently as an ally during the events at [[Petersburg Wilhelmplatz]], then using them in [[reality theatre]].

The pack has learned that the Jaggling members of this court tend to build domains for themselves in retreats in the Shadow, places that have no direct physical reflection, and rarely leave them. Interestingly, the broods of those Jagglings often contain members of other courts. Politics seem to be on an individual basis with the Jaggling members.

It is assumed that all Jaggling members of this court are also members of [[the High Court of Petersburg]]. The court has an old alliance to the [[Urban Ronins]], but is in conflict with the new stronger courts, [[Fleshmade]] and [[Blood of the City]].

The [[Steel Predators]] have an old feud with this court, something about a broken deal a century ago.

He had a wife, although it is unknown if she will stay in St Petersburg now - and, frankly, since they lived in a different part of town, the pack couldn't care less.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1229">Shuro is a wiry figure of slightly taller than average build. He usually dresses in very plain clothes, perfect for blending into the crowds of St. Petersburg. He is rumoured to be quite a fighter, and it is true that he can move with extreme grace if he chooses so. Little else is known about him.

Shuro made his first appearance to the pack in the meeting of all werewolves belonging to the [[alliance]], where he did not speak all evening. It was clear to most that he watched with quite some interest, though.

He was later crucial in resolving the problems that occurred during [[the old werewolf's last play]], but he demanded a price for his help the extent of which has yet to be seen: The [[Shadowclaws]] now have to advance their borders into the no-man's-land between the two packs to fulfill their part of the deal, narrowing the hiding place for rogue spirits and other unpleasant things.

Shuro is of Japanese ancestry, though how far this reaches back is unknown. He helped Angus [[Claidheamh_mòr|smelt]] the iron for his sword with an ancient technique.

Shuro has some secret that he is willing to kill for - a fact that [[Taras Mihailov]] found out the hard way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1331">Asovitch Rohrbau is the second largest employer in the pack's territory - the first is [[Drnaya Steel Works]]. As the name implies, the company builds pipes of all kinds, some of which use the metal produced by Drnaya.

The company was recently involved in the [[battle against Rote Wut|events around the unrest in the south]], when it became clear that they were involved in the southern mafia and the waste disposal scandal. In addition, they had seemingly kidnapped the son of one of [[Grigor]]'s superiors - who later turned out to be 'hijacked' by a rogue spirit. Nonetheless, the supposed kidnapping resulted in a bloody Mafia battle on the grounds of Asovich, which saw the factory closed for police investigation. Since large parts of the management are accused of having taken an active part in the toxic waste disposal and are currently awaiting trial, the factory remains closed. The salaries of the employees have been put on hold two weeks ago, and it is not clear at the moment what the future holds for Asovitch Rohrbau.

The Hisil of the factory ground is believed to be part of the area claimed by the [[Spirits of Fire and Steel]], although the recent events - the shootout and the closure - have surely led to the emergence of more unpleasant spirits in this area.

'''Childhood'''

-- yet to be translated --

Ich wurde 1977 in St. Petersburg geboren, als zweites Kind von ??? &amp; ???. Meine
große Schwester ??? ist 4 Jahre älter, mein großer Bruder ??? 9 Jahre. An meine
jungen Jahre habe ich wenig Erinnerungen. Meistens hat meine Geschwister auf
mich aufgepasst, weil meine Eltern ebensoviel arbeiteten, wie sie tranken. Manchmal
haben wir Urlaub auf dem Zeltplatz gemacht. Damals war es für mich das
pure Abenteuer.

Irgendwann fing für mich die Schule an. Wir waren ausschliesslich Kinder aus
den unteren sozialen Schichten. Viele waren regelmäßig auf den Strassen unterwegs
und haben geklaut. Kindern trauen Touristen so etwas meistens nicht zu,
und so hatten sie meistens ein leichtes Spiel. Es gab halb-organisierte Kinder-
Banden, die von Älteren ”beschützt“ bzw. ausgenommen wurden. Ich hatte anfangs
nur mitgemacht, um akzeptiert zu werden und um dazu zugehören. Doch
dann merkte ich, wie lukrativ es war und ich besserte damit mein nicht vorhandenes
Taschengeld auf. Ich wurde Mitglied in einer kleinen Gruppe, die sich
auch Team-Taschendiebstahl spezialisiert hatte. Einer quatscht Touristen an oder
spritzt ihnen irgendetwas auf die Hose, ein anderer erleichtert ihn um sein Bargeld
und ein dritter ist als Reserve dabei, um bei einer Flucht (soweit nötig)
Verwirrung zu stiften. Zwei Mal wurde ich beim Klauen erwischt. Beim ersten
Mal wusste ich noch nicht, dass man die hiesigen ”Ordnungshüter“ schmieren
kann. Ich kam für sechs Monate in ein Heim. Mich wieder in die Gruppe zu integrieren
gestaltete sich als reichlich schwierig. Die Gruppe hatte sich verändert,
es waren Neue dabei, die Hierarchiestrukturen hatten sich geändert. Meine neue
Position war dann etwas abseits als ”Ausbilder“ für Neulinge. Beim zweiten Mal
(ein Lehr-Diebstahl) hatte mich ein idealistisches Greenhorn erwischt, den ich
zwar nicht bestechen aber immerhin davon überzeugen konnte, mich laufen zu
lassen. Ich hatte ihm was vorgeheult, von wegen Leben im Eimer, Zukunft verpfuscht,
werde es nie wieder tun, etc. Er hat es mir tatsächlich abgenommen. Ich
weiß bis heute nicht, warum.


Meine Laufbahn als Taschendieb war hiermit zu Ende, wer zwei Mal erwischt
wird, hat es versaut. Ich wurde aus der Gruppe rausgeworfen. Zu einigen von
damals habe ich allerdings immer noch Kontakt.
Nach meinem Aufenthalt im Heim musste ich die Schule wechseln. In dieser Schule
gab es immerhin kein all zu kriminelles Umfeld, und ich ging auch regelmäßig hin.
Angespornt von Eltern und Geschwistern versuchte ich sogar gut mitzuarbeiten.
Nicht um aus meinem bis jetzt verkorksten Leben etwas vernünftiges zu machen,
sondern um zu verhindern, dass ich irgendwann wieder in ein Heim muss.
1987 (ich war 10), hat mein Bruder eine Polin geheiratet und ist zu ihr gezogen.
Kurz danach ist unsere Wohnung ausgebrannt. Mein Vater ist im Vollrausch mit
einer brennenden Zigarette in der Hand eingeschlafen. Es ist keiner zu Schaden
gekommen, aber wir haben viele Habseligkeiten verloren und mussten in eine
noch kleinere Sozialwohnung umziehen. Seit dem ist der große Streit ausgebrochen.
Meine Schwester hat meine Eltern angebrüllt, sie seien Säufer, Versager und
was-weiß-ich-noch. Über mehrere Jahre haben sich meine Schwester und meine
Eltern gegenseitig das Leben zu Hölle gemacht. Irgendwann hat mein Vater angefangen,
sie derart zu verprügeln, dass sie in ein Krankenhaus musste. Als ich
13 war, ist meine Schwester dann weggelaufen. Ich wusste, dass sie weg wollte,
hätte aber nicht gedacht, dass sie es tatsächlich tut. Ich hatte nicht mehr all zu
viel mit ihr zu tun, dennoch hat es mich belastet, dass sie verschwunden war.
Aber ich habe sie für ihren Mut beneidet, ein neues Leben zu beginnen.

'''Youth'''

Ich wechselte die Schule ein zweites Mal (diese sollte besser sein, als die beiden
vorigen). Als nun einziges übriges Kind begannen sich meine Eltern mehr um mich
zu kümmern. Außerdem haben sie auch an sich selbst gearbeitet. Sie tranken nicht
mehr ganz so viel und meine Mutter hat sogar eine besser bezahlte Anstellung
als Sekretärin bekommen. Sie hatte vorher das 10-Finger-System an einer alten
Schreibmaschine geübt. Als sie die Stelle bekommen hatte, haben sich meine
Eltern sogar einen Computer angeschafft. Um auch zu Hause arbeiten zu können,
hat der Chef meiner Mutter uns sogar einen Internetanschluss spendiert. Meine
Gruppenzugehörigkeit habe ich dann im Internet gesucht. In der neuen Schule
habe ich keinen wirklichen Anschluss finden können. Die anderen haben sich als
etwas besseres gefühlt, für einen halber Strassenköter, der schon als Kind im Heim
war, waren sich die kleinen Damen und Herren zu fein. Zum ersten Mal habe ich
ein Gefühl dafür bekommen, wo meine Familie in der Gesellschaft eigentlich steht.
Das Bild, was die Medien und die Schule von Russland zeichnen, unterscheidet
sich ziemlich krass von dem, was ich bis jetzt erfahren habe. Man erfährt nichts
über die Klassenunterschiede oder die Armut, keiner sagt, was ihn an diesem Land
eigentlich stört oder was man anders machen könnte. Nur im Internet konnte man
andere Meinungen aus anderen Ländern über Russland erfahren. Ich erfuhr über
die Medienzensur in Russland.

Die neue Schule begann mich anzuöden. Meine Mitschüler in ihrer eigenen kleinen
Welt gingen mir auf den Wecker und der Schulstoff interessierte mich auch nicht.
Mit 16 habe ich dann die Schule ohne Abschluss geschmissen. Anfangs wollte
ich irgend etwas mit Journalismus machen. Ohne Abschluss habe ich allerdings
keinen Ausbildungsplatz gefunden. Schließlich habe ich -immer noch fasziniert
von den Möglichkeiten des Computers- eine Ausbildung zum Fachinformatiker
bei InfoTec, einer noch recht jungen russischen IT-Firma angefangen. In diesem
Sektor gab es so viel Bedarf, dass sie mich glücklicherweise auch ohne irgendeinen
Abschluss genommen haben.

----

My notes end here. wtf? What happened to the rest? I will need to browse some old backups. May be it shows up. But this is a quest for another day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3866">== A world of insanity ==


Some time after the [[battle against Rote Wut|struggle against]] [[Rote Wut]] has died down, the signs increased that something was foul in [[Edouard Lambert|my]] [[Pack|pack's]] [[territory]]. There was this incident which our [[Aleksandr|Irraka]] has witnessed. A small number of humans walked akwardly in the middle of the street and behaved as if they came from some decades old movie.

At about the same time, another [[Angus|packmate]] was attacked by some humans who behaved like one of the many bandits in Robin Hood stories. They threatened him to give them his money, and when he didn't comply, they tried to attack him.

And [[Edouard Lambert|I]] had to witness what might look for others like a tragic accident in a theatre. At the end of the play, the actor played out the suicide of his character. He raised a gun to his head. He pulled the trigger. The bang was as loud as the audience was silent. The actor dropped to the floor, and a red, wet puddle started to form around his head. There were only two things that instantly sprang to my mind. First, I didn't want to attract too many spirits so close to our [[territory]] that would come leeching for the essence that would invariably form if the spectators decided to panic. And second, I had absolutely no intention of attracting big media. So I did what any Uratha would do: Watch out for the herd, placate them and keep them oblivious of the real reasons that are as obvious as the rise of Mother Luna at night.

Thanks to the [[Pack|pack's]] coordinated actions, the root of all these incidents was soon discovered. It was a lone Uratha who did his best to guard a banned entity's prison which can be accessed through a pair of mirrors. He did this by making a great performance in front of an enthusiastic audience. The essence that is created by the emotions of the spectators is then used to strengthen the prison. The negative sideeffect of this is that a great deal of essence is not used for this strengthening, but it is consumed by spirits which grow bolder from time to time. The Uratha was very old and he had a talent with the show which he performed night after night, always in different locations. His audience loved it.

The [[Pack|pack]] wisely chose a diplomatic way to approach the guardian. His grand-daughter [[Nadja Ivanetsch|Nadja]] is a woolf-blood, and the [[pack]] made some effort to him through her. While we tried to contact her in a bar, a misunderstanding arose somewhere and a shooting began, in which [[Nadja Ivanetsch|Nadja]] became injured and fled with her van. Three of the [[Pack|pack's]] Uratha took together all their agility and followed the van on foot until she was safely in her flat.

It didn't take long to persuade her that her flat was not a safe place to stay, and she followed the pack to [[Edouard Lambert|my]] appartment, where she immediately felt safe and protected.

With [[Nadja Ivanetsch|Nadja's]] aid, we could meet the guardian at one of his performances and help him carry the mirrors to [[Edouard Lambert|my]] appartment, where he patiently explained to us the finer points of what lies behind the shiny surface of the mirrors. Behind it lies a wold of insanity. In it, you can walk a straight line which crosses itself, you can walk on a floor which is supported by nothing but warped emptyness, and its very aura can be harmful.

&lt;enter the details of what happened there and why here&gt;

The way in which the [[pack]] worked was most remarkable. To the [[:Category: Vampire|naive]] it might have been the easiest way for the pack to tell this Uratha to take his mirrors perform his magic somewhere else. But the pack chose a wiser way. Not only did it remove the nuisance within its territory, but it also prevented possible destruction and agony somewhere else.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4711">Renown is a measure of how well-known and well-respected a werewolf is, in particular among spirits. While they hate and often fear werewolves, spirits still acknowledge the power and wisdom of the half-breeds.

Renown is split into five fields, each representing a particular virtue respected in the Hisil. The more a werewolf is respected in a particular field, the stronger the gifts that spirits are willing to teach him. The more total renown a werewolf has, the higher his rank amongst spirits - some legendary werewolves are even rumoured to be respected as minor gods, though few if any have even met such a paragon of Renown.

Renown is gained through living by certain standards. Rarely is a single act enough to earn a new rank of Renown, and most werewolves choose to focus on two or three of the five categories. To simulate this, the group awards 'Renown-XP' at the end of sessions. There is also the possibility to tell of some personal feat by making an entry on this fine Wiki. This can gain up to one Renown XP between two sessions. The five kinds of renown, and ways to earn them by making an entry, are as following:

==Cunning==

Unconventional solutions, new ideas, a successful indirect approach. Possible ways to gain a Cunning XP are spreading tales of one's personal feats (as the deception of St. Petersburg official in the investigations surrounding Grigor's Rage), protecting the Oath indirectly (for example, by discrediting rumours about wolf sightings, as were even in the papers once - one could write an article by the character, or a tale how an 'investigation' led astray by a werewolf produced wrong results, or even how a lawsuit filing for 'causing public unrest' condemned the newspaper to pay a fine for their unbased claims), or simply a new way to see things (for example, the fight between Rote Wut and the Shadowclaws was also a fight between two different criminal organisations in St. Petersburg - but which one was the cause?).

==Glory== 

Winning a victory, possibly for higher goals than self-interest, or telling a tale of big achievments (not necessarily one's own). Possible ways to gain a Glory XP are telling a good story (like the [[The Eternal Guardian|tale]] of [[Edouard Lambert|Edouard]] about the pack's latest adventures), spreading tales about the noble motivations of one's latest victory (like not having killed the old man and instead going for the undoubtably tougher enemy, only not to hurt [[Nadja Ivanetsch|Nadja]]'s feelings), or inspiring other forsaken by giving an example of 'good' actions (as retelling how Grigori made the long voyage from Siberia towards a pack he left, because he still felt a duty towards them).

==Honour== 

Fulfilling one's duty or oaths, uncovering lies and falsehood. Possible ways to gain an Honour XP are telling a tale of one's honourable behaviour (for example, how Grigor was the last one to retreat before the stone knights in the strange castle, to make up for his earlier blunder), spreading stories about how oneself or one's pack fulfilled an oath no matter what the cost, and even if there were simple ways out, or simply reflecting about ones behaviour (e.g., make an entry about what the character thinks about the recent events, and how he justifies his behaviour, and where he thinks he went wrong).

==Purity==

Adhering to the principles of harmony. Possible ways to gain a Purity XP are telling a story how oneself stayed true to the oath, even if it was inconvenient and 'unnecessary' (e.g., how one held a tenet that would have been above the Sin threshold despite adversities), reflecting on the upholding of the oath (writing an entry how the character thinks about the recent events, where and why they went against the oath - and how it could have been avoided) or simply spreading tales of one's self-restraint and 'harmonious' behaviour.

==Wisdom==

Application and gathering of knowledge. Possible ways to gain a Wisdom XP are forging new pieces of lore (for example, write a story about the strange mirrors as it could be told from master to student), telling stories about one's own wisdom (for example, how Angus applied a variation of a known rite to cleanse the locus - this could also be a description of the rite) and reflecting on the true reasons behind recent events (make an entry about how the character thinks about the recent events, and the wisdom of the actions they took - as well known, in hindsight one is usually wiser!).

I hope this helps a bit. These are only suggestions, so as a general guideline anything vaguely associated would do. In fact, you would have to mess up quite heavily to not be awarded an XP : )

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4826">&quot;I need a Dog's Collar&quot;, thought Angus. Too often had he ached
to change into the Wolf Form, too often had a partial change of
his nose proven too little, too late, and too complicated. 

His Ritual skills had recently improved to a level that he had
learned how to make talens and fetishes. It was now time to test
his skills in crafting a proper fetish, his very first
one. After procuring the necessary mundane substances, only the
spirit to be bound into the fetish was missing. A dog spirit was
all Angus now needed and he knew exactly where to find those: he
and his pack had numerous dealings with stray dog spirits in the
sewers. Given those... aggressive dealings with the dogs, Angus
didn't think he could convince one of them to actually help him
out. Still, you have to try, he sighed. Respect all spirits. And
one of the dogs might able to be persuaded with the safety a
fetish would provide. He had no high hopes, though; his
bargaining skills were no-where as honed as [[Edouard]]'s. 

Finding the dogs was easy enough. He found one of them in the
sewers and was quickly able to pin him down. &quot;What do you want
now?&quot;, growled the dog. &quot;I want you, or someone else. Doesn't
matter. Someone of your choir.&quot; -- &quot;What for?&quot; Angus knew the
dog was playing for time, waiting for his brothers to come to
the scene. And he knew, he couldn't hold a whole pack of dog
spirits at bay, as [[Grigor]] had already done. He was beginning
to get angry. &quot;I want to create a Dog's Collar. I need a dog.&quot;
-- &quot;Oh, so you need my ''help''?&quot;, the spirit asked
mischievously. This particular spirit had a way of pulling his
strings. &quot;No, I do ''not'' need your help!&quot; Angus replied,
almost hissing his reply as his irritation was steadily turning
into anger. &quot;I'm being polite and offering an
opportunity. Perhaps you want to find out what's going on
outside of the sewers? Perhaps you need to get away from here?
Blast it! What do I care? I could grab you right here and
''drag'' you back!&quot;

&quot;And how would you accomplish such a feat, Swims-under-Ice? You
are no Bear's Bane!&quot; Just what he needed, a second dog had
arrived at the scene. &quot;I need not be&quot;, answered Angus. &quot;We are a
[[Shadowclaws|pack]], and I can always return with him.&quot; -- &quot;Oh,
so you need ''his'' help then, to be able to fulfil your ''own''
duties as an Ithaeur?&quot; the first dog taunted. A deep growl was
Angus' answer and his claws moving warningly into the spirit's
flesh. &quot;For this to happen&quot;, the newly-arrived dog calmly
responded, &quot;you would need to get to him first!&quot; -- &quot;No&quot;, Angus
replied furiously. He didn't want to lose his temper, but he was
dangerously close to it. He ignored the feelings of wrath
rising. &quot;We are a pack. You kill me here, Bear's Bane will
arrive here faster than you can say 'Rahu in Kuruth'.&quot; --
&quot;Perhaps, but ''you'' won't be here any more!&quot; 

With this, the second dog charged. He was larger, and more
magnificent than the first dog Angus still had pinned to the
ground. He would not be able to fight both at the same time,
Angus knew. With a quick slash of his talon, took a large piece
of flesh from the pinned dog. This would keep it occupied for a
while, he hoped. But it left the initiative to the attacking
dog. Its first tackle hit Angus hard and sent him
flying. Quickly he stood up and let his Urshul teeth bite into
his foe. He feeled the taste of sewage in his mouth, as he bit
the dog. The second attack from the spirit was even more
powerful than the first. Angus was sent skidding backwards,
mauled by the hit. He felt the red haze of his Rage arriving...

He couldn't change into Gauru now. Doing so would risk
discorporating both spirits, and Angus still wanted to keep that
annoying first dog spirit to force into his fetish. And he knew
he needed to make quick work of the second dog, otherwise his
chosen target would be back in the fight. No Gauru, plus the
need to end the fight quickly... not the best of
circumstances. Tapping into his reserves, Angus jumped back into
the fight -- with both his adversaries: the spirit and his
Rage. His charge slammed the spirit to the wall. A bite into the
dog's hind legs followed. Both animals -- dog and wolf --
howling and fletching, Angus finally landed a lucky blow and the
spirit discorporated into hundreds of shards.

Just in time, Angus thought. The haze of Rage and battle was
slowly dissipating and he saw the first dog limping away. He
quickly followed and grabbed it. &quot;You, my friend&quot;, Angus said
to the dog with delight, &quot;will look nice in a collar.&quot; And with
great satisfaction he grabbed the spirit and ran out of the
sewers before more spirits came to intercept him in his current,
weakened state. He would have particular fun in binding this
spirit into his first fetish. Angus grinned at the thought of
this.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1362">'Admiralteyski Wochenblatt' is a local newspaper in the Admiralteyski district of St. Petersburg. Published somewhat irregularly (read: as the GM has time), it is mainly concerned with the going-ons in the pack's territory, and therefore an important source of information for the pack. Devoting a large section to 'reader's opinions', the newspaper is a good measure of the current mood of most humans in the territory - an essential factor in spirit politics. Below are the editions the player characters have, with an approximate date of publications.

      <comment>/* Angus' Lodge Initiation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11774">Almost all werewolves in [[Petersburg]] are part of some [[lodge]]. Usually, they chose their lodge and pass their initiation within the first year after their respective [[Tribe Initiations]]. The members of the Shadowclaws are no exception from that, and most of them have already chosen which lodge they will  try to enter.

== Angus' Lodge Initiation ==

[[Angus]] is an Initiate of the [[Enlightened]]. He passed his trial during the [[Battle against Rote Wut]]:

''The warehouse did not look different from all the others at the pier, except for the brutish guy standing next to the entry. He passed Angus a fierce glance, then nodded and opened the door.

''Stepping inside, the young Storm Lord noticed that the warehouse was almost completely empty, except for a group of werewolves forming a circle around some small bowls on the ground.

'' 'Step closer, Angus Swims-under-Ice. We have been expecting you.'

''The werewolf at the far end of the circle had talked. He was an impressive figure, measuring about two feet in his Dalu form and wielding a huge two-handed sword, adorned with countless chains and animal tokens. His bare body was covered in tattoos and markings, showing the [[Renown]] he had earned over the years. It was none less then [[Victor Flammendes-Schwert]], eldest of the Enlightened and High Jugde of St. Petersburg.

''There were about half a dozen werewolves present, all wearing nothing but their tattoos, a few ornamental chains made mostly of animal parts, and a weapon - some ritual, some looking quite deadly. Angus only recognized two of them: [[Vanya Sokolow]] and [[Dima Kochegarov]] of the pack [[Litanei der Straßen]].

''Not hesitating for even a moment, Angus stepped into their midst. He knew that showing any form of weakness would be the quickest route to failing any trial set by Storm Lords.

'' 'What brings you here?', the High Jugde asked.

'' 'I wish to be accepted into the Lodge of Enlightened.', Angus answered, in a determined voice.

'' 'Very well. Then you will answer our questions.'

''In a flash of light, the five bowls around Angus caught fire. Immediately, the thick smell of heavy incense filled the air and clouded the vision of the young Iminir. The smoke seemed to drift towards him, wrapping him in a poisonous embrace and robbing him of his sense of direction. Then the questions started.

'' 'Define Discipline.' - 'What does your totem mean to you?' - 'What would you die for?' - 'What does 'pack' mean to you?' - 'What is the proper punishment for a pack member who violates the oath?'

''Angus fought against unconsciousness as the smoke filled his loungs and poisoned his blood, yet he stood tall and proud and answered every question without hesitating. There was no feedback to his answer except for a new question, coming out of the smoke, untraceable, emotionless. Reddish-black dots and lines started filling his sight, and he suspected that the incense used here was on the list of illegal substances.

''He couldn't tell how long the questions continued or if there was any feedback to his answers at a later date. At some point, he lost consciousness and collapsed to the floor.

''When he came to, he was still in the warehouse - lying naked on the floor of the empty building. The only remains of the trial were the smell of incense in his hair and a headache of monumental proportions. There was no sign as to if he had passed or failed. He climbed to his feet and staggered to the door - it was locked. Hesitating only breifly, he broke down the door and somehow made his way home.

''For two days, he heard nothing from the Enlightened. Then he decided that merely waiting for jugdement was not the way of the Storm Lords and went to seek it himself. He travelled to the territory of the High Judges pack and howled for a meeting.

''Victor smiled as he greeted the young Iminir at the [[Schatten der Zaren]]s border.

'' 'Congratulations, young Storm Lord. You have passed the trial. You see, nothing we could set for your trial would ever match what Winter Wolf subjected you to during your Initiation into our tribe. Yet the fact that you return and ask for more shows us that you are willing to dedicate yourself to the additional burden that lodge membership is. You are now an Initiate of the Enlightened. Call upon us if your need is dire.'

'' 'You know what our lodge stands for. We are scholars collecting the knowledge needed to guard the Gauntlet. We are leaders needed to face the dangers of two worlds. We are diplomats, for only a fool goes without allies, and only a broken soul simply kills every problem he encounters. Prove you can carry out our duties, and you will be considered a true member.'

''As the old werewolf turned and left the scene, Angus allowed himself a smile. Another trial mastered.

Angus was accepted into the lodge after proving himself, learning about its [[The Legend of the Lodge of Enlightened|origins]].

== Grigor's Lodge Initiation ==

[[Grigor]] aspires to join the [[Bear Hunters]]. He already enquired about requirements with [[Yelena Dimitrovna]], but received only the short (and blunt) answer that a werewolf with his state of the soul would never be a member of the lodge. A werewolf below Harmony 5 will simply not be able to truly understand the concept of 'teamwork' shared among the lodge.

Some weeks later, after [[Grigor's contrition|recent events]], Grigor returns to speak
with Yelena. He will tell her something of his recent struggles to control his rage and
his efforts to maintain his humanity. (Harmony is now 5.) Since he is soon to be responsible for leading a group of inexperienced fighters in battle (a Mafia &quot;unit&quot;
of youths in the south of the territory), Grigor desires to teach them to fight
effectively as a group. Also, he wants to learn how to prepare his pack better for
battle. As a gesture of his commitment, he swears never to make any deals or alliances
with the [[Roter Hof|Red Court]] in his territory, since they represent uncontrolled
violence and rage. (He will only hint at his experiences there.)

Yelena is shortspoken as ever, cutting in when Grigor starts speaking about what he wants to learn. She tells Grigor that she will keep her ears open about what the spirits will have to tell of his deeds. Since the Red Court seems to be a problem in his area, once he has helped his pack to a victory against them, she will hear him out. A victory without innocent deaths and aside the whole pack, that is - not a solitary rage where some spirits of the court happen to be among the victims. Until then, she will not waste her time on him. If he cannot follow others into battle and stick by their orders, there is no way he will ever learn to lead.

After the [[The fate of The Bleeding Stone|fierce struggle]] against the [[Roter Hof|red court]], Grigor was approached by Yelena. With considerable disdain, she told him that while she still thought it a bit early, he was invited to a [[The hunt at Autumn Equinox|collective hunt]] of the Bear Hunters. There he should be able to demonstrate his abilities and his willingness to join.

It was only after the events sorrounding the [[Eristoffs]] that Yelena approached Grigor once again. It was obvious that she knew about his recent rage, and what the spirits where wispering. In few and strong words, she reminded him of his duty to uphold his harmony. Then she reached into her pocket and drew out a leather wristband. A piece of bone was worked into the leather.

&quot;Extend your arm.&quot;

Grigor did as told. Yelena grabbed it and drew a knife, making a clean cut across his underarm. Dipping her finger into the blood, she drew some symbols onto the piece of bone.

Then she let go of his arm and repeated the procedure on herself. Afterwards, she gave the band to Grigor.

&quot;This is a talen of our lodge. It is a symbol that we will bleed for each other, and a reminder that we stand and fall together. Next time you feel Kuruth grasping you, remember that. It will help you fight it.&quot;

&quot;As for your full initiation, I will watch you closely. Your pack has tasks ahead of it that will require a concerted effort. Remember your lessons.&quot;

Then, she left without saying another word.

After hunting the Rahglu Queen with Boneblade, Yelena tells Grigor that while he still has a long way to go, at least he has shown that he is willing to step down from Glory for the sake of the team, thereby proving himself worthy of being a Bear Hunter. He is now a full member of the lodge (but still fresh, so his Mentor merit stays for a while).

== Aleksandr's Lodge Initiation ==

[[Aleksandr]] has [[Disco Fever|applied]] for the lodge of Lightning. Now he will have to show he fits in ...

== Grigori's Lodge Initiation ==

Yeah, um, Ghost Wolf? ...

== Edouard's Lodge Initiation ==

As the mayor finished his speech and walked to his car, [[Edouard]] couldn't help but smile. That man hat not moved a finger to have the new [[youth club]] build, but naturally claimed all the credit. Not that he'd mind - it was better if no one knew of his involvement, although it had cost him quite some money. As far as the City administration was concerned, the money had come from some private investors who would like to remain unnamed, fearing they might be bothered by requests for aid from a multitude of charity organisations if their involvement came to light. [[Angus]] had handled that - the alpha knew where he had to go in the administration to get things done, and whom to avoid to keep things secret.

A bit to his right, [[Grigor]] gave Edouard an approving nod as he stepped into the shining new building. A youth center for the children of the impoverished immigrants in the south of Admiralteyski - the idea had come from the Rahu, but the pack as a whole approved of it. Edouard turned and left. The celebration here was not for him. No doubt there would be a 'charity dinner' or something in the better part of the city, where the rich would pad themselves on the shoulder, applauding their charity while sipping incredibly expensive wine out of crystal glasses. That was where he belonged, listening to their gossip, trying to spot what motivated the 'makers' in the city. At least, that's what he made of the credo of the [[Shepherds]], whom he had recently requested to join.

He remembered [[Andrei Wind-in-den-Straßen|Andrej's]] words. 'Alright, so you wanna join? And now you're wondering, what trial will we set? Well, you're already an Iron Master. You know we are not one of those crazy 'rip-your-guts-out-to-prove-your-dedication' organisations as the Blood Talons or Storm Lords tend to go. If you really wanna join, well, you're in. Turn to me if you ever have questions. If you can't answer them by yourself, that is.'

'You know what the Shepherds are about. We tend to the herd like noone else. Only by truly understanding them will you be able to understand the huge impact they have on your territory, on both sides of the Gauntlet. So, what we'd like to see from you is that you can do just that. Understand humanity. Sounds simple, da? Well, as I said, don't rip your guts out. We know when you are ready. See ya!'

Then he had left Edouard standing alone, somewhat confused. The young Cahalith thought for a moment and then decided that, typically for the Iron Masters, he'd have to figure out himself exactly what they wanted him to do. So he had set about making his way into the social elite. After all, he knew from his life as a human that money was the name of the game - and he intended to play.

Edouard was [[Charity Dinner|accepted]] into the lodge after [[Strategic Investment|strategic investments]] [[Investors for Neighbours|into]] [[Neighbours for Neighbours]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="992">Yelena 'Melodie des Eisens' Dimitrovna is a Blood Talon Ithaeur of the [[Litanei der Straßen]]. She is the only one of the [[Bear Hunters]] known to the pack that resides within the city, making her the natural contact for [[Grigor]] in his quest to be invited to the lodge. So far, she has not proven very favourable.

Yelena could probably work as a fashion model with her looks, if she were to lose a few pounds of muscles. However, she seems to have no ambitions of this kind, instead spending her time ceaselessly working towards the pack's goals. Like the rest of her pack, she appears to have drawn the short straw were humour is concerned -- it is a rare sight to see her smile. Usually, her face is one of stern concentration -- or disapproval. She wears leather clothing adorned with symbols that would probably mean something to a member of the Bear Hunters. She usually carries a spear into battle, very likely some sort of fetish.

But tribes don't take anyone - most require some task from the would-be-member to prove his worthiness. It was no different for the Shadowclaws.

== Angus' Tribe Initiation ==

== Grigor's Tribe Initiation ==

Grigor was initiated into the Blood Talons in some kind of basement. Awaiting him in a cage was a polar bear, and the tribal elders informed him that he would need to defeat it in single combat. As a result of his (close) victory, Grigor decided to adopt the name Bear's Bane, and was accepted into the tribe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19793">[[Grigor]] paced down a busy evening street, an ugly scowl on his face. He had just
had a heated argument with [[Angus]], which had left him in a foul mood. The
[[Shadowclaws|pack]]'s alpha had made his concern over Grigor's recent conduct quite
clear, but Grigor hadn't been in the mood for a lecture. It looked as if the young
Rahu hadn't shaved or showered in a while either, although any body odour was
overpowered by the stench of one of his foul cigarettes which he was openly smoking,
leaving a trail of coughing and grimacing passers-by. As for the large,
suspicious-looking stain on Grigor's T-shirt... well, best not to ask.

A middle-aged woman tried to make her way past Grigor, shielding her nostrils from
the smoke with a frown on her face, but he rudely shoved her aside with his shoulder.
&quot;Well ''excuse'' me!&quot; she exclaimed, but Grigor didn't even deign to acknowledge her.
As he finished barging his way through the crowd waiting for an approaching bus, the
last guy shoved his fist into Grigor's shoulder. &quot;Hey pal, what the fuck is your...&quot;
Grigor whirled around with a savage look that mutated into a cold smile. &quot;Go on,&quot; he
thought to himself, &quot;be my guest. Take me on! Give me all you've got. That's the
only excuse I need to...&quot; Grigor imagined how easy and satisfying it would be to crush
this man's flimsy neck with his bare hands. He pictured the crowd of worthless and
irritating people fleeing before his righteous wrath... The belligerent guy seemed to
read the deadly menace in the Rahu's eyes, however, and the protest died on his lips.
He mumbled something under his breath instead and hastily shuffled away.

His thirst for random violence thus unsated, Grigor stumbled back to his apartment.
The place was none too clean and reeked of blood-smoke, but to Grigor's eyes and
nose it had a comforting familiarity. He immediately went over to the freezer and
grabbed one of the few remaining haunches of frozen meat, shoving it straight in
the dirty microwave. He next opened the fridge. This seemed to be the only
organised place in the apartment, where a small collection of phials of blood and
cigarette packs were scrupulously labelled and arranged. His fingers drifted
momentarily along the cigarette collection, before selecting one. Puffing heavily
on the lit cigarette, Grigor pushed his face up against the glass door of the
microwave, staring hungrily inside, his fingers tapping impatiently. As soon as
the meat was ready, he ripped it out and began devouring it ravenously,
subconsciously shifting his jaws and stomach into Urhan form. He gnawed it to the
bone, even though the meat had not completely defrosted. After eating, Grigor
retrieved his mobile phone and briefly contemplated calling up one of his packmates,
but decided against. He downed a large glass of vodka before slumping into his bed,
where he was soon fast asleep.

...

The snow flurry parted momentarily to permit a view of a small group of figures,
cloaked in black, shivering in the winter chill. They were bowed at the edge of
a graveyard, where the last of several coffins was slowly being lowered into the
frozen ground. Grigor struggled forward against the cold, trying to get a closer
look. The wind shifted direction and he momentarily shielded his eyes against the
blowing snow. When he looked up, he instead felt raindrops beating against his face.
The figures ahead had changed somewhat, but the burial scene remained the same,
albeit with spring rain in place of winter snow. He cleared his eyes again and this
time felt hot sunshine. The mourners had shifted positions again but the last coffin
was still being lowered. As the faceless priest spoke words which Grigor could not
discern, he noticed a hunchbacked old woman dressed in a black shawl. She had her
back to him, but dabbed at her wrinkled brow, mopping away sweat and tears. Slowly,
comprehension dawned. She was mourning her daughter. And her grandchildren too --
her whole family, those who had been savagely and suddenly ripped away from her.
Grigor suddenly felt a strange connection and sympathy with her, although he didn't
quite know why... As he shuffled closer, the old woman turned to face him with a
sorrowful expression. Then she gasped as recognition flashed across her reddened
eyes. Her crooked finger slowly rose to point, accusing, at Grigor. &quot;''It's you...''&quot;
she rasped. Dumbfounded, Grigor slowly shook his head, but a mounting sense of dread
and horror was rising within him. He stared into the crone's accusing eyes and could
not tear his gaze away until, finally, the red mist of Kuruth claimed him.

The bestial Gauru form that was Grigor fled in a jumble of savage limbs away from
the graveyard, tearing frantically at tree branches in his way. He stumbled onto
some kind of street. Distantly, someone or something screamed, as he smashed
through some group of large objects. A sinister metallic construct with bright
gleaming lights was barrelling down the street and so Grigor leapt over a wall and
towards a house, away from the road. He seemed somehow unable to manipulate the
door, and so instead smashed through it. A confusing array of doors and rooms and
stairs met him... As he scrambled his way through the building, a figure stood in
his way. It shrieked and turned to flee, but it was too slow. Grigor swatted it out
of his way with a massive sideswipe of his Gauru claws and it crumpled in a heap.
Another room... More screaming obstacles. He silenced them too, before stumbling on,
desperately searching for some kind of exit... Smashing through a flimsy glass
barrier, he fell from some considerable height, but landed without noticable
pain. He ran for a short while more, but another threatening cluster of buildings
loomed in his way. More stairs... Another screaming face... another crash...
another shower of blood... another obstacle removed... All Grigor wanted to do
was to reach sanctuary, but it never came. Instead, a neverending sequence of
obstacles, doors, and flimsy, faceless, shrieking figures stood in his way. He was
exhausted and blood-soaked, but his rage and fear drove him on. There seemed to be
no way out...

...

Grigor woke with a start and sat up abruptly in his bed, shivering in a cold
sweat. His sheets were torn to shreds; looking down, he saw that his hands had
shifted involuntarily to oversized claws. After catching his breath, the Rahu
slowly made his way to the bathroom, trying to shake the nightmare from his
brain. He slumped with his hands on the basin, eyes closed. He washed his
hands and splashed some of the water on his face. Straightening up, his eyes met
the mirror. The face of a Gauru, with burning Kuruth-red eyes, met his gaze.
Grigor gasped involuntarily. However the Gauru-head did not match his movements;
instead its fearsome jaw slowly wrenched into a horrific kind of grin, blood dripping
from its teeth. Grigor turned away and closed his eyes, but another visage flashed up
behind his eyelids -- this time a woman screaming in abject terror, hands raised in
self-defence. A momentary shard of recognition hit him as a bestial arm flashed
before the woman, leaving nothing but a spray of blood. Grigor opened his eyes
again to face the mirror. The monstrous Gauru-head nodded imperceptibly, still
smiling coldly, and he recognised it. He was looking at himself. Trembling,
Grigor shook his head. &quot;Fuck you,&quot; he snarled at the Gauru, smashing his fist
into the glass. The wall shook and the mirror and image both disintegrated. Grigor
slumped to the floor, his left arm drawn across his contorted face, clutching his
bloodied and glass-strewn fist.

...

That evening, just after dusk, Grigor made his way along the deserted and silent
road to the graveyard. The entrance gates were padlocked shut, but he vaulted over
them effortlessly, with a leap that an Olympian would have been proud of. Fumbling
the torch out of his pocket in the dark, it took him a while to find the right spot.
Several fresh graves lay side-by-side at the edge of the graveyard, a family
group. Grigor grimaced and turned to face the grave of the mother. Unhooking his
backpack, he sat down, cross-legged, before the headstone. He fished out the small
photo, which he had cut out of the [[Admiralteyski Wochenblatt]], and laid it before
the grave. Here, the woman was gently smiling, but that was not how Grigor recalled
her in his split-second memory fragment. Grigor assembled some basic accoutrements
from his rucksack -- candles and a portable brazier, which he lit, and a dagger.
When it was ready, he inserted the dagger into the brazier, and let it heat up. The
Blood Talon slowly rolled up his left sleeve to reveal several tattoos on the upper
part of his slightly weaker left arm, representations of each of the groups of
mortals that have fallen victim to his rage. The names -- crudely transliterated
into First Tongue -- and symbols were at least as numerous as those on his right
arm, representing vanquished foes, which he did not reveal. The skin on the most
recent tattoo, the latest on the list, was still sore. Grigor steeled himself and
slowly withdrew the knife from the fire, placing it before the newest markings on
his arm. He sucked air through his gritted teeth in pain as the tip of the hot blade,
sizzling slightly, penetrated his skin. It was going to be a long night...

As dawn came, Grigor stumbled out of the graveyard, clutching his pack with his
right arm, bloodshot-eyed, and a burning pain persisting in his blood-encrusted left.

...

Angus sat in a yoga pose, eyes closed, deep in meditation... Footsteps slowly
approached along the corridor outside, before a hand opened the door, permitting a
figure to enter. Angus flicked open his eyes, but his scent and awareness had already
told him who it was. Bear's Bane. He frowned in irritation. The last thing he needed
was for the wayward Rahu to disturb his peace, only for him to make the same crude
joke about no-one attending his class for the dozenth time. He was about to shoo him
away, until he noticed that the usual stupid grin was absent from Grigor's face. In
its place was an unfamiliar expression... Doubt? Shame? Realisation quickly dawned --
his packmate was not there to poke fun at him, after all. The Storm Lord permitted
himself a short moment of inner satisfaction before he pointed sternly towards the
center of the empty classroom. &quot;Sit.&quot;

...

Grigor whirled around to look behind him, fists bunched and ready, but no-one was
there. It was past midnight, and the street was quiet. It was a warm night, and he
was feeling jumpy and restless. There was the merest hint of a strange scent on the
humid air -- he wasn't sure what it was, but he felt something -- or someone --
calling him... After some aimless wandering, Grigor found himself at the
[[Black locus|small chapel]] in the southwest of the pack's territory. He made his
way into the church; it was silent, dark, and dusty. A sense of gloom and regret
came upon the young werewolf, and he contemplated prayer. Still, Grigor didn't
really feel like talking to God right now. All his prayers as a boy had gone
unanswered, anyway. Why should tonight be any different? After a while, he made his
way towards the altar and stared curiously up at the crucifix. Something -- perhaps
a breeze -- then raised gooesbumps on his skin. Ah yes, the locus here! He smelt
the strange scent again, stronger. As is often the case, it seemed he should seek
answers in Hisil.

The Rahu passed through the Gauntlet and into the Shadow Realm, and the darkness
and emotions of the chapel intensified. Not too far away there were watching
spirits... Grigor had never really felt at home amongst the denizens of the spirit
world, and he had always gotten the impression that the feeling was mutual. He
shifted into Urshul and made haste.

His restless search had somehow led him into the sewers, and he prowled his way
through the labyrinthine tunnels and waters. He detected the recent scent of
[[Angus crafting a Dog's Collar|one of the dog packs]], but that didn't concern
him right now. He'd deal with those vermin if they crossed his path.

Finally, and with a mounting sense of foreboding, Grigor came the to the Abyss. In
the blackness beyond, lay the [[Roter Hof|Red Court]], the home of the spirits of
violence, perversion, pain, and torture. The scent was much stronger here, and it
tasted of blood. Grigor contemplated crossing the threshold to the court -- he had
only entered in once before, briefly, but he felt no desire to repeat the
experience any time soon. Breathing heavily, and starting to sweat nervously,
Grigor contemplated his next move. He steeled himself. He was a warrior -- whatever
it was, he would face it. He let rip with a great wolf-howl, a challenge to battle
that echoed along the black tunnel and down inside the court. It was answered only
with the distant background noise of hooting laughter and the agonised screams of
torture deep within.

He waited, tensely. For a long time, there was no response, until, finally,
he noticed someone or something slowly approaching from behind the Abyss. At first
there was nothing but glowing red eyes, dauntingly high and wide, accompanied by a
slow, hissing, breathing. The thing emerged from the blackness and into the
halflight of the sewers -- unmistakably some kind of great Gauru-like beast, but
without the frenzied motion associated with that form. Instead, there was a
deliberate, cold malevolence about it. It stared down at the determined Urshul
before it and let off a snarling baritone chuckle. Grigor gasped as he felt a
burning in his shoulder, at the scar where [[Nadja Ivanetsch|Nadja]]'s silver
bullet had struck him, triggering his most recent rage. He felt the same agony,
panic, and wrath rising within him... but managed to keep himself in check.

Grigor had already seen quite a few Gaurus in his relatively brief time as a
werewolf, but most of them hadn't bothered or scared him overmuch. This one,
however, was especially formidable and nightmarish. Still, he had even faced the
Pure in battle before, albeit briefly. What bothered him more about this foe was
the unmistakably human blood dripping from its maw and sprayed over its face, and
the remains of entrails and skin smeared across its torso. More than that, even,
Grigor recognised more than a hint of his own mortal image in his opponent's
visage. &quot;Who...&quot; he began, but his opponent cut him off. &quot;You know who I am,&quot; it
growled in the First Tongue, &quot;I am Bear's Bane. You! The Uratha you are destined
to be. Am I not magnificent?&quot; It laughed again.

Grigor had never been big on chit-chat or clever taunting before battle, so he
simply bit off one of the few Uremehir retorts he knew, followed by a formidable
warning growl, his usual prelude to battle. His opponent responded only with a
horrific anticipatory grin, the same that he had seen in the mirror. The slightly
smaller Urshul leapt at the nightmare Gauru and battle was joined. Epic crashes
and snarls echoed loudly through the sewers nearby and wise lesser spirits knew to
keep away...

Bear's Bane leapt at the Gauru-thing again, but his opponent retaliated with a
massive swipe, smashing the Urshul against the side of the tunnel. It didn't
follow up, however -- it was almost as if his opponent was taunting him. Grigor
got back up again immediately with a snarl. Clearly, he was going to have to fight
to his maximum capability... He shifted to Gauru and launched a ferocious attack,
this time striking home. For a frenzied few moments, the two nearly identical
bestial forms traded shattering blows. They were evenly matched, although somehow
-- perhaps because he was fighting with every ounce of his will, whereas his
opponent seemed content to merely match or taunt him -- Grigor gained the upper
hand. He battered the Gauru-thing to the ground with a mighty punch-like swipe,
and it lay there gasping, momentarily exposed... Grigor's Gauru time was up. But
he needed to keep his maximum strength to press the advantage! He just had to
free himself from his limitations, to let the rage of battle flow fully through
him, and victory would be his... He envisioned his mighty Gauru jaws ripping out
the vile beast's throat in battle frenzy...

Suddenly Grigor seemed to hear his pack alpha's voice in his head, as if from
some great distance. &quot;You idiot! It's feeding off your rage!&quot; With a tremendous
effort of will, Grigor shifted back to Urshul and held himself back from the
potentially killing blow. The beast's gasping mutated into a great bellow of
laughter as, drawing itself up to its full height and terror, its wounds vanished
into nothing. If anything, it seemed even bigger and stronger than before. A wave
of despair came over Bear's Bane - he knew now that this was one foe he could not
defeat. Licking his wounds, and with a final desperate snarl of hatred, he leapt
back from the Abyss and ran away, limping slightly, to the sound of his nemesis'
laughter echoing in the sewers behind him.

...

A pack meeting had been called in [[Edouard]]'s new residence. Grigor arrived
slightly late, and only noticed the opulent surroundings in passing. His packmates
were all waiting for him -- even [[Aleksandr]] had somehow managed to make it on
time. Grigor raised one hand in half-apology, half-greeting as he entered. Edouard
looked impatient. &quot;Grigor, we have important business to discuss here.&quot; Grigor
drew a deep breath. &quot;Yeah, I'm sure. But I want to do something first. Well, more
to say something, really. Uh... well, you'll see.&quot; He had brought some things with
him: candles, the brazier, and something in a lunchbox. Edouard hid a flicker of
annoyance and glanced over to Angus, but he seemed calm and patient, with a hint of
satisfaction, as if he knew what was happening. Edouard shrugged and let Grigor
carry on. Grigori looked up from his newspaper with an expression of curiousity.
Grigor hastily arranged his things and began the rite...

After a couple of minutes, the scent of the candles and of the burning meat,
which Grigor had taken out of the lunchbox and ceremonially placed onto the
brazier, began to pervade throughout the room. Kneeling, Grigor then turned to
Aleksandr. &quot;I know that I have too often succumbed to Kuruth,&quot; he began
awkwardly, &quot;and that the whole pack has suffered.&quot; He glanced around the room
with a guilty expression. &quot;Others too... It is you, Talks-to-Trees, who has
suffered the most. Twice now... at least twice... or I think it was only two
times...&quot; He seemed to be struggling to remember his rehearsed speech for the rite
of contrition. &quot;Anyway, I attacked you. In my rage, I mean. Could've killed you...
Uh, I'm glad I didn't though. Shouldn't have done that.&quot; The Rahu paused for a
moment, and took in a deep breath. &quot;I... I apologise. And I ask your forgiveness.&quot;
He repeated it in First Tongue, offering the burnt meat to the Iron Master with
both hands. He tilted his head to one side, exposing his bare neck. Aleksandr
looked somewhat confused and unsure, and looked to Angus for guidance. The Ithaeur
slowly nodded in approval. &quot;Ss'uthaf,&quot; Aleksandr answered, &quot;I accept.&quot;

...

Back in the Shadow Realm, Bear's Bane went in search of the [[Spirits of Order]],
following Angus' instructions. He knew that it could be dangerous, and that the
court probably regarded him as an enemy -- Angus had told him that they were
allied with the police. With some trepidation, Grigor came to the edge of their
realm. He shifted from Urshul to Dalu, so that he could manipulate the objects for
the ritual. Swallowing nervously, he began the rite of contrition, to apologise for
his latest killing spree. This time, he was less confident about the answer...

    <title>Angus sending a messenger to Nadja's grandfather</title>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6572">Nadja smiled as Angus returned from the woods, signalling her to disembark from the car. Since she had agreed to stay inside the boundaries set by Angus restricteand his [[Shadowclaws|pack]], she had little opportunity to leave the district. This was a welcome diversion. It was also, at least that's what Angus had told her, the best way to contact her grandfather and tell him what happened after he left.

They went up a small hill, into a copse of spruces. Angus took a few candles out of his pockets and begun arranging them in a certain fashion. Then he laid a dead rabbit down on the needle-strewn floor, still bleeding slightly. She realized it didn't shock her nearly as much as it should - too much had happened since she had recovered from the terrible injury that had left a huge scar across her torso two weeks ago. Her relationship with Angus - though somewhat hesitantly pursued from her side - had taken her into a world she hadn't even dreamed of before. It still filled her with a certain disbelief when she was confronted with the fact that much of what was considered superstition by the public was actually real. Yet here she was, trying to send a message to her grandfather via a spirit.

While Angus sat down cross-legged and began an incantation in a sonoric voice - at least that's what she thought it was, since none of the sounds he made were anything near words - her thoughts drifted back to when she first awoke after her injury. [[Edouard Lambert]], a packmate of Angus, had been keeping watch over her. She had been stunned to realise the wealth displayed in his appartment - before then, she had considered werewolves as savage beasts, housing as Angus did in run-down buildings. Yet Edouard was a successful businessman, and seemed to have money aplenty.

The pack had been very protective of her, and as Angus told her some uncomfortable truths about the world she lived in, she had started to realise that her life would be vastly different from now on. No longer would she be able to run away from the pack and hide from the dark truth - now she was fully embroiled in the conflicts that raged behind the curtain of 'scientific reality'. And after all, it wasn't that bad. Most packmembers were quite nice when she got to know them closer, and Angus wasn't even bad-looking. Besides that touch of unboundd ferocity all werewolves possessed, he was quite an attractive young Scotsman. Only [[Grigor]] scared her everytime she saw him. She could sense the rage and fury burning behind his eyes, and her scar started to ache everytime he got to close. She suspected his claws would match it quite well. Luckily, he kept out of her way most of the time.

She snapped back to reality as Angus' sonorous howling aprubtly stopped, only to be replaced by another voice. A small wolf had manifested before the Ritemaster and started feasting on the rabbit. Between the huge chunks it ripped out of the dead mammal, it spoke in a strange voice, reminiscent of a howl. Somehow she knew that this wolf, real as it seemed in the twilight of the copse, was not a creature of this world. She just hoped the fear that gripped her didn't show too openly on her face.

'What did you call me for, Ithaeur?'

'I want you to do something for me.', Angus responded in Russian.

'And what makes you think I would grant it to you, Forsaken?', the strange creature responded.

'I can offer you something in reward.'

'Why do you thing you have something I want?'

'Because there is something all of you want.', Angus said, putting his left arm in the mouth of the creature. Nadja let of a scream as the creature bit, ripping a chunk of flesh out of the Ithaeurs forearm. Only a small twitch of the eyes revealed the pain the young man had to feel as the creature swallowed the flesh and nodded approvingly.

'Very well. Here is the deal. I will find whom you want to be contacted, and deliver a message. You, on the other hand, will hunt down the men who have been preying on my kind in these woods.'

Angus showed no reaction. At first she thought that the flesh of his arm slowly healing itself took all his concentration, but when he answered, it appeared that he had been thinking on his reply. He later told her that hunting wolves in this woods was forbidden, so the men hunting them had to be poachers. If it had been officially condoned, he would have had to find another way to pay the spirit for its service.

'Very well. I will hunt for you whom you cannot best, if you hunt for me whom I cannot catch.'

'Then tell me whom you want caught, and what message I shall bring him.'

Nadja waited as Angus gave some details about her grandfather - the little information the two of them had been able to dig up the nights before - and then pointed to her.

'This young women will give you the message to relay.'

Although Angus had told her as much, words couldn't prepare her for what she felt as the spirit turned its attention on her.

'So, my kin, what message do you want me to bear your ancestor?'

'I ... well. I guess you can tell him that I am now with the ... the alpha of the pack that freed him from his burden. That I am safe ... or at least I think so.'

She cursed herself silently. She had a speech prepared, but the otherworldly gaze of the creature and its strange words upset and confused her.

'I ... I hope he is well. Tell him I miss him. Tell him Grigori explained to me why he left. Why he couldn't stay in a town without going mad ... or even madder, as things are. Tell him I understand. I ... I hope to hear from him at some time. All of this is so ... confusing. I ...'

She looked at Angus. Although she had suspected he would be present, she realised she didn't want to speak about all her feelings in his presence. Not yet.

'I guess I will be happy here.'

She looked away, no longer able to bear looking at the wolf.

'Is this all, Granddaughter?'

She nodded slowly, still looking away, covering her torso and the aching scar with her arms. Why granddaughter?

'Very well. We will not meet again, I guess. Sad.'

And with these words, the creature vanished. She stood there, confused, cold and afraid, until Angus put an arm around her and slowly led her to the car. She could feel the warm blood from his still bleeding wound, but she didn't care right now. All she cared about was not to repeat this experience anytime soon, and protection from the strange entities that threatened this world. Protection she hoped to find in the arms of a werewolf, she thought sarcastically.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6356">It was late at night when [[Angus]] entered the Peter and Paul Fortress under the watchful eyes of the Enlightened. After they had said down in a pleasantly furnished room, [[Victor Flammendes-Schwert|Victor]] gave a nod to [[Dima Kochegarov|Dima]]. The Cahalith rose and started speaking.

''&quot;You know the legend of Silver Wolf and the first, failed, attempt to replace Urfarah? When Father Wolf was weakened from the poison of the Hag Queen, the Ivory Claw's totem tried to replace him. He failed though, and fled from the rage and fury of the primal wolf, licking his wounds. He did not return until our Ancestors had brought Urfarah down.&quot;

''&quot;Well, there is a local legend attached to it. It says that it was here that Silver Wolf fled, and here that he first betrayed our duty, as the poor tribes continue to do until today. Instead of guarding the border marches, he made a pact with a mighty spirit of winter. While Silver Wolf would be able to hide in the vast spirit wilds of modern day Siberia, the spirit was allowed to cross and spread its influence under the cover of his followers, thereby escaping punishment by Father Wolf. It is a sign of their false strength: The Pure assess that the strong may take what the want and the weak should give in. In the end, it resulted in the creation of much of the modern-day Siberian tundra, as the spirit's cold influence transformed the land.&quot;

''&quot;You know that Silver Wolf seeks to destroy all the legends surrounding his defeat by Urfarah. This is no different, and knowing the legend will mark you as a victim for the Ivory Claws, more than your tribe affiliation already does. Three hundred years ago, a Storm Lord struck a deal with a spirit of lore that would see the legend survive the onslaught of the Pure. Yes, it was during the Great Northern War, when Peter the Great was in the area. They were the ones who gave him the idea to found a new city here, a city of learning, where Russia could modernize. It was to become a window where the light of Enlightenment could enter Russia. A Window to the West.&quot;

''&quot;If all would have went according to plan, the spirit and the city would have become one, the [[Window-to-the-West]], a place where lore meets new thoughts and creates Enlightenment from it. It did not, of course. The City is not only a place of learning and lore. It is also a place of violence, as it's construction claimed hundreds of lives and marked the emergence of Russia as a power in the European theatre. It has seen more war and sieges than many an older city. Therefore, the spirit of the City is not one single entity. True to the church, which was the first building to be erected in the city, it is threefold. It is Window-to-the-West, a place of science and lore, of thought and Enlightment. It also is a place of art, as it is still one of the culturally most important cities, outshining even Moscow at times. But it is a place of violence, too. A place of dismissed suffering and death, where a few would reap the benefits of the sacrifices of many. This face of the city is simply known as [[Daemonium]]. As is human nature, it quickly grew stronger than Window-to-the-West.&quot;

''&quot;The [[Enlightened|Lodge of Enlightenment]] thrived, and for over a hundred years the Forsaken held the City and watched the borders between Shadow and Light, true to the Oath. Then the pure allied with Daemonium and attacked in numbers too great for the Forsaken to handle. In the 19th century, we lost the city, and we lost the legend with it. For the next hundred years, the Pure tried to destroy Window-to-the-West, to eliminate the legend from memory. They did not succeed.&quot;

''&quot;Then Flammendes-Schwert encountered it. He was already a powerful Werewolf when he met Window-to-the-West, and instantly took it upon himself to reforge the old pact the Storm Lords had made with the spirit. In the course of a few years, he had united a few packs of Forsaken. They were not many, but it had to be enough. And it was. We retook the city, reforged our pact. Now [[Alliance|we stand together]]. The city shall not again fall to Silver Wolf's servants.&quot;

''&quot;This is our secret. The lodge is not young. It is reborn from the ashes left by the Pure, and its duty is to never again show weakness by letting them take the city. The place that symbolises our pact. Our ally. The Window to the West.&quot;

It had grown cold in the room, Angus noticed. Outside the window, an owl holed. It was a snow-white owl, a rare kind. All seemed to notice, yet nobody pointed it out. Then Victor arose.

''&quot;Now you are a full member. Your duty is clear: Keep the alliance intact. Protect the legend. Protect Window-to-the West. You can train with us, from now on. Our ally offers some insight into the ways of lore, diplomacy and leadership that few mundanes are able to achieve.&quot;

''&quot;It will be your choice alone how much of this you tell your pack. The lore about the faces of the city, it's spirit being split, might sure prove important. The Legend might be interesting to some, though you should be aware of its risks. One thing, however, the basis of our lodge, is a secret that is forbidden to outsiders. Our pact with the city itself. I'm quite sure we killed all the pure that knew of their pact with Daemonium. I don't want to give them any ideas about renewing it.&quot;

''&quot;One more thing: Our ally is not a spirit of lore and enlightment without a reason. We have access to one of the biggest collections of tales and legends in the area. Another of our non-open secrets, though. If you ever need access to it, contact me. There is a price, though. We failed Window-to-the-West once. The new terms of our pact are less favourable than they had been...&quot;

And with that, the meeting was over. Angus left the fortress and started on his way back. Then he noticed he wasn't alone. Turning around, he found [[Vanya Sokolow|Vanya]] behind him.

''&quot;Ah, young Iminir. A word. I don't know how much you care about some epic purpose behind your fight. Myself, I couldn't care less. What I care about is that we can keep the Pure at bay, as long as we keep this alliance up. All the rest might just as well be only that. Legends. Don't let it go to your head.&quot;

None had realised what had been especially weird about the white owl: Its eyes had been of pure silver.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18348">==Intro: Hunt!==
After a period of calm, where the fighting in the immigrant quarter ceased almost completely, violence seemed once again to be on the rise in the south of the territory. Incidents where people were beat to death with a blunt object increased in frequency, and there was no obvious pattern in the victims: From lone people wandering to streets at nights to families in their homes, everyone appeared to be a target. That most were of Finnish or Ukrainian origin appeared to be a result of where the killings took place: In the northeast of the area.

The pack first heard about the killings from the newspapers. Later on the same day, [[Grigor]] overheard some of the youths visiting his 'self-confidence through self-defence' course talking about it. They mentioned that [[Josuv Stanov|Josif]], a troublesome youth that once also had attended the class, claimed to have seen the murderer. Grigor decided to investigate. After all, the mafia had put him in charge of the territory there.

His investigations soon led to success, as he was able to find the place of the last killing only a short time after it happened. While he lost trail of the murderer on the rooftops, he was able to have a look around the scene of carnage before the police arrived. The arriving [[Shadowclaws|pack]] managed to follow the trail a bit further, but lost it on the boundary of the territory, where a small channel caused a wide gap between the houses.

The next night, the entire pack was patrolling the area, determined to put an end to the perpetrator of those crimes. It took a while, but then [[Edouard]] got lucky: While cruising down a street he observed a TV flying from out of a nearby building. The noises from inside left little doubt, and he hurried upstairs, pushing past fleeing people. He found the rooms as Grigor had described them, in a total mess. And then he found the killer.

His enemy reacted the decisive split-second quicker, and while Edouard was still trying to get used to the half-darkness in the flat, his opponent jumped him and hammered a blunt object into him. The force of the blow was enough to knock him off his feet, and when he got up again the aggressor had vanished. Calling [[Grigori]] on his cell-phone, he went up to the roof, in the hopes of finding him there. The pack arrived one after another, but neither Grigori nor [[Aleksandr]] was able to stop the creature. Only Grigor managed to keep on its tail, jumping from one roof to another. He followed the creature to the [[St. Nicholaus Cathedral]], where it entered the supposedly locked upper part - and vanished. All Grigor found was a small trail of surprisingly neutral blood.

It was then that events started to unfold.

==Act One: Old debts==

[[Die Amazone]] called for a meeting with the pack. She was accompanied by three other werewolves and had obviously managed to be accepted into the Iminir tribe. Her request was a simple one: The use of one of the pack's loci for a month, to aid in the reconquest of her former territory. The pack took a day to consider, but finally agreed, in exchange for a future favour.

At the same time, the [[Prince of the River]] also requested for a meeting, calling in one of his five favours. Apparently, some object called 'the Bleeding Stone' was an offense to his court. He wanted to destroy it. The pack's part would be to find it and bring it to him. He lacked any specific information about it, so their first task would be to find out what the hell it was.

They got lucky: There was a newspaper story about a legend of a bleeding stone, so part of the pack set out for the [[Church of our Saviour on the Blood]] mentioned therein. They had little success. Grigori went to the library, researching the legend, trying to find clues to what it was. He discovered a disturbing thing: There seemed to be an older, nigh-forgotten legend associated with a bleeding stone. This would make the object at least two millenia old, instead of one. Whatever spirit was associated with it, it would be quite powerful.

It took a trip to the spirit world and an annoying game with the spirits in the [[garbage-burning facility|former theatre]] to find out the rest. For a hefty sum of essence, they told the pack that the bleeding stone was both a spirit and an artifact. It was, in practical terms, a mobile locus possessed by its spirits. As it could change sides at a whim, everywhere, it was close to impossible to hunt down. They would have to find another way.

This other way appeared to be an old ritual observed by the more important spirits in the inner city of St. Petersburg - a trial by peers. It seems that most of the older spirits in the city adhered to decisions made by a gathering of spirits at least their rank near - or on - Palace Square, on nights when the moon is split. All that was required was a majority by four votes. The pack's task was clear: Secure the votes of at least four spirits of Jaggling rank.

==Act Two: A trial by peers==
One vote they had for sure: That of the Prince of the River. After all, it was him who wanted the stone. Die Amazone also agreed to help them out as her favour. It was when they asked the other werewolves in the city that they realised that there was a hidden cost: Obviously, partaking in such a trial signalled the spirits that one would also be subject to it. No werewolf wanted the spirits to decide about him, so they could not find further sponsors this way. They even decided not to call in the favour with Amazone after all, if they could find enough spirit sponsors.

The [[Steel Spider]] was the second spirit they asked, and it demanded but a single thing in return: That a vehicle be used in the sewers. They readily agreed, and it was not until they spoke with the [[Meister im Norden|smuggler spirit]] in the sewers that they found out there was a hidden cost, again. The spirits of steel constructs in the sewers were obvioulsy bound with an old oath to guard the borders of the [[Roter Hof|red court]] - something the Steel Spider would be free of, because she would become a [[Steel Predators|steel predator]]. The smuggler spirit was unwilling to help, not wanting to get involved.

There was another steel predator that would be able to help them, though. During their first investigations, they had met [[T-34]], the spirit of a truck. It is the steel predator hunting in their territory and to the west of it. Hit hard by the introduction of a new speed limit, the spirit agreed to sponsor them if they made sure it was removed. Though the pack was initially suspicious that the spirit had agreed so easily, there seemed to be no hidden costs this time.

[[She-Who-Was-Eternally-Lost]] was the next spirits whose help they could enlist. Caught in a power struggle among the gloomy ones against [[Pitch Black]], she asked a heavy price for her help: The lives of innocent people, lost in tragic accident. While she was quite fervent about their deaths being accidental and tragic, thereby falling in her domain and not in that of the red court, the pack was still hesitant about it. Then they realised that they could use these deaths to remove the speed limits, placing them in the newly created zones. So they agreed.

While they still considered enlisting the help of [[Prinz Yaromir]], who wanted a spectacular action that stopped the garbage-burning facility for some time, they had a stroke of good fortune - or so it appeared. While investigating an urged in the police station, [[Angus]] was told flat-out by his lawyer that they had another vote, because someone called in a favour. The obviously possessed man was gone too fast for Angus to do something, especially in the middle of a police station.

So they had five votes, with one uncertain, and an additional one for backup: Die Amazone went to the meeting, to vote if the opposition should have too many votes. It proved unnecessary - the stone dropped into the real world at the [[Palace Square]] close to midnight, and the pack went to the river to deliver it.

==Act Three: A bloodhunt==

The pack went straight for the river to deliver the stone and finish their task. Just when they had parked their van and started disembarking, they came under heavy fire from the buildings on the opposite side of the street. Retreating back into the vehicle, some of them badly injured, they used their smoke grenades to get some cover from the deadly fire. They then retreated through the River, Grigor taking care of another attacker in a boat with a mighty leap, Aleksandr shooting an attacker in a nearby car. Angus delivered the stone while diving, at least taking care of that part. Aleksandr remained behind, hidden by one of his Gifts, trying to gain more information on the identity of their attackers. They spotted him, though, and he barely made his escape.

Thus the pack was seperated, some of them heavily injured. They decided to gather at their locus, yet only Angus made it unmolested: Grigor and Grigori were attacked in the streets. Angus was visited by the chief of police, [[Nievo Ashkov]], who had received reports that Angus and some of his friends were responsible for the shooting. During their drive to the police station, they were attacked by a black limousine.

It soon became clear that they were being hunted, as Grigor found fliers indicating them as criminals and promising a quite high bounty for their death, and a small bounty for any hints on their whereabouts. Police quickly gave up the idea that Angus was responsible - not the least due to the attack on Nievo and him on their drive to the station, so they only had to deal with the threat of several hitmen searching for them.

As they started investigating the ones behind the attacks, there was another shock: Grigor was told flat out by his boss that the mafia wouldn't help him with that business. They helped him find those who attacked them on the pier, though. They seemed to have only recently arrived in St. Petersburg, on a plane from the states. When the pack went to the address the mafia gave them, they found their assailants slaughtered. As Grigors boss told them the mafia was not responsible, this posed another riddle.

Their best lead in finding the ones behind the attacks was the cell phone number from the fliers for reporting sightings of the pack. With the help of Aleksandr's contacts, they were able to find it in a welded-shut mailbox in some appartment to the east of their territory. It redirected the calls to two public phones. After a thrilling vehicle chase down one of St. Petersburgs more vivid shopping streets, which ended with Angus tossing a flashbang into the pursuing vehicle and a spectacular crash as the driver went out, they kidnapped both persons at the public phones without drawing a lot of attention.

Interrogation proved exceptionally easy, and it soon turned out that both of them were ordinary citizens short of cash, who knew almost nothing. They would note where the pack had been spotted and tell it to guys who came buy every thirty minutes. They were able to point them at a specific building, though, which was likely the headquarter of their attackers, as the same black cars that were looking for them were often seen entering its garage. Gathering their sparse resources for a battle, the pack prepared to enter the building.

The building contained a number of appartments, a doctor and a lawyer's office. The inhabitants were able to tell them that the lawyer's office in the top two floors was what they were looking for. They went in, and hesitated just long enough for the secretary to ring the alarm. Combat ensued, and most off the lower floor was ruined as the pack made its way through half a dozen henchmen. Ascending to the top floor, they encountered no more resistance until they reached the bureau of the lawyer himself.

Crashing through the door in Urshul, they found [[Ivana]] cowering on the floor between two spirits, clearly members of the red court or violent ones. Ivana escaped screaming as the pack threw themselves at the spirits, bringing them down in less then a minute. They found evidence that they had attacked the right place, but they did not find the lawyer himself. Then they heard police sirens and decided to leave the building while their was still time.

Checking back on Ivana by phone, Aleksandr learned she had been in her appartment all day. It didn't take them long to figure out they had found their enemy, after all. They just had let him escape.

==Act Four: A question of allegiance==

Knowing their enemy had the ability to shapechange, the pack again faced an opponent who would be almost impossible to hunt down. They needed to find a way to clearly identify him and bring him down, without drawing undue attention. And, more than anything, they needed to know whom exactly they were facing.

Their investigations were met with problems, as few spirits seemed willing to cooperate out of fear of retaliation. They also found out that the [[Handmaidens of Bloodshed]] had been paid to hunt them down in the Shadow. Further adding to their problems was the conflict in the south, with the [[Crimson Tears|new pack]] reclaiming the territory of [[Rote Wut]], which threatened to spill over due to the other packs use of their locus.

[[She-Who-Was-Eternally-Lost]] finally agreed to help (for a hefty price), and shed light on the affair: Apparently, the spirit of the Bleeding Stone was not affiliated to a court, but bound to its artefact. By destroying the artefact, the spirit became unbound, and would have dissolved if not for the legends on the artefact, which it would represent. The bloody christian legend being enforced recently, the spirit would very likely change to the red court  - a new, powerful member, as it was a Lesser Jaggling.

So the Lawyer, a powerful member of the red court, had tipped of the Prince of the River about the existence of the stone, and let the werewolves do the work. Afterwards, it planned to get rid of them before they realised they had been used. They were even able to learn his ban: As he represented 'unfair justice' and drew his essence from people wrongly sentenced, he was also subject to 'court orders'. The problem, now, was how to get and deliver an order to a person who could be anyone.

After a few days of research, Grigori and Edouard worked out a scenario: Since the man convicted of murdering Edouard's friend would most likely be severly punished, but was largely innocent, the Lawyer would likely be there to feed on his aspect. Of course, it would be in a shape they would not know beforehand, but Grigori remembered an old clause in russian law called the 'order for truth'. The judge would issue this in some trials, and it meant that everyone in the courtroom was bound by law and god to be true. Now largely out of practice, it would likely force the spirit to reveal its true form, as it was a court order affecting it.

The pack hesitated initially, but decided to give it a try. Edouard worked his connections to have the judge issue the order, reasoning that his deceased colleague would have liked that. So the pack gathered among the visitors in the courtroom, hoping for their scheme to fall into place. As the judge issued the 'order for truth', a cry echoed from the jury. One of them had jumped up and was running out of the room, his hands pressed against his face. The pack instantly gave chase.

==Final: Hunt!==

Aleksandr was the first in pursuit, followed closely by Grigor. They chased the man to a window, where he simply jumped out - followed only seconds later by the werewolves. Outside, a black car and two man with submachineguns were waiting. The Lawyer quickly boarded the car, and it went off while the pack was held up by the two hitmen. They hijacked another car and gave pursuit, just as the guards from the court building arrived. Grigor managed to keep closely behind the car they were following, despite them going more than a hundred kph in a tempo 30 zone. The car finally crashed next to the gates of the [[Summer Garden]], the Lawyer getting out and running into the park. Trying to simply run him over, Grigor accelerated. Then the man simply vanished in the middle of the gate, and the pack's car shot into the park.

Getting out and running back, they realised the gates were a locus. Switching to the other side, they saw their prey vanishing into the distance. The park looked very different from the real world: A thunderstorm was blowing rain almost horizontally, and the ground was flooded about 30 centimeters high. The Lawyer was also not the only one here: They recognised the Ridden responsible for the killings in the immigrant quarter blocking their way. One of its arms had mutated into a giant club.

While part of the pack still chased the Lawyer, Aleksandr stayed back to fight the Ridden. A deadly mistake: The beast only inflicted bashing damage, but the force was still enough to almost knock the injured werewolf out in one blow. The second hit send him to the ground, battered and broken, close to death. It took a combined attack by the rest of the pack to overcome the beast.

The Lawyer having gained distance, all but Aleksandr resumed the chase. He left the park and ran onto the [[Field of Mars]]. As they chased him across the place, they noticed statues manifesting around them. Soon, the pack and the Lawyer were sorrounded by statues of ancient warriors. A booming voice was heard: 'Noone runs from combat on the Field of Mars! Stand, and fight!'. Having nowhere to run, the Lawyer turned around and launched himself on the pack.

Grigori took the man down with a brutal blow, giving in to his primal fury. It took Angus all his power to restrain his raging packmate, so Grigor was left to fight the spirit emerging from its slain host on his own. A lesser jaggling, the spirit was a formidable foe, despite not being attuned to combat. Soon, the Rahu was bleeding from several wounds. Calling on his warrior gifts, he managed to bypass the defenses of the spirits, getting in a decisive blow that discorporated the enemy.

A long, victorious howl sounded through the shadow. Once more, the Shadow Claws had shown that they could and would stand up to any foe threatening their territory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24172">==A gathering of kindred souls==

Grigor motored along the rough country road, his black leather jacket
zipped up tight against the early autumn chill. He was by now a fair ways
to the northeast of St. Petersburg; to his right were the remains of a
few straggly fields and hamlets; ahead and to his left, nothing but wild
forest, brooding and dark. The young Rahu was speeding fast on his Yamaha,
but even he was struggling to keep up with his guide. He squinted ahead in
the failing light of late afternoon: [[Yelena Dimitrovna]], in a red vintage
sports car, was driving as if possessed. Grigor grimaced and pulled his
woolly hat tighter over his unhelmeted head, before ramming the
accelerator again...

A few assorted vehicles had been parked on the side of the road -- by now
little more than a dirt track -- adjacent to the forest. Grigor pulled up
and saw that Yelena hadn't waited for him. He nervously lit up one of his
cigarettes and peered into the gloom under the trees, shivering slightly
in the wind. There appeared to be some recent tracks and wolf-scent, and
so the prospective recruit followed. In a clearing a short ways in, most
of the other [[Bear Hunters]] had already gathered. Melody of Iron -- Yelena
-- was being greeted warmly by the others. She didn't seem to pay any
attention to Grigor or introduce him, so he hung back at the edge of the
group. The Rahu recognised some of the faces from the last gathering of
the Blood Talons, where it had been his honour -- or perhaps simply luck
-- to strike the killing blow against their foe, but the majority were
unfamiliar to him. A couple of them nodded at him in acknowledgement, but
he also noticed more than one hostile glance or snarl in his direction.
Clearly not all of the Bear Hunters were convinced of his worthiness.

The group of werewolves indulged in some light sparring as they waited
for the ceremony to begin. Yelena, in Dalu form and dressed in a
ceremonially painted leather breastplate, wielding an axe and a spear,
faced off against a tall Dalu in chainmail, swinging a two-handed
great-axe. Another pair shifted to Urshul and began squaring off, probing
each other's defenses, although they never seemed to actually trade
blows. Grigor watched from the back and momentarily contemplated joining
in. His boxing opponent from the Blood Talon gathering seemed to absent,
however. In fact, the more he thought about it, this was obviously no
place for a boxer, an individualist, a lone fighter. He wondered whether
the [[Blood Seekers]], crazy as they undoubtedly are, might not have been
more suited to his talents... He shook his head. It was too late now! He
had decided to throw in his lot with these guys, and he had to make the
best of it.

At the onset of dusk, the Hunters gathered around the fire at the centre
of the clearing -- there were maybe a dozen or so in total. An older
looking red-bearded Dalu, whom Grigor did not recognise, stepped forward
to speak. He raised one fist in the air and proclaimed gruffly, &quot;My
fellow Bear Hunters, on this night of the Equinox we gather once again
for our traditional hunt!&quot; Shouts and murmurs of approval. &quot;Our quarry
this night is an especially ancient and dangerous one: the Predator
Kings!&quot; A mixture of growls and hisses broke out among the audience.
Grigor himself felt his throat go dry. Predator Kings - the fiercest of
the Pure! He had only faced off against such an opponent once, and only
then had been required to hold it off for half a minute or so... As he
contemplated the magnitude of this task, Red-Beard continued to speak of
recent battles against the Pure, and of how others in the city had
pleaded for action to be taken, and of the Bear Hunters' duty and honour
in answering the call...

==The hunt is on==

At the end of the speech, met with battle-howls and cries of approval,
the small group of the Forsaken set about the hunt with the minimum of
delay. They seemed to gather immediately in three groups. The first,
involving Yelena, consisted of a formidable-looking armoured group,
wielding a variety of great swords and axes. The second, and smallest,
consisted of three Dalus dressed in camouflage and carrying backpacks,
wielding sturdy rifles. Two appeared to be traditional huntsmen but the
third had more the seeming of a military sniper. The largest group
consisted simply of an athletic-looking bunch in Urshul form. Still
nobody seemed to pay any attention to Grigor, so he was going to have
sort himself out, and quickly -- it didn't seem like anyone would want
to waste time with his questions. The Rahu quickly shucked off his
leather jacket and clothes, pulling out his heavy pistol. He weighed it
contemplatively in his hands before tossing it aside with a shrug. You
don't bring a pistol to a rifle hunt, and human fists aren't going to be
much good against an armed foe, let alone the Pure! Naked, he shifted to
Urshul form and joined up with the last group.

The Urshuls were the first to leave the clearing. Seeing Bears Bane join
along, the seeming leader of the group growled at him in First Tongue to
keep up and not make any noise. They sprinted silently into the dark
forest...

As they ascended a long rise into a hilly part of the forest, Grigor
found himself bounding along near the rear of the group, struggling to
keep up. His fur soon became damp with sweat, despite the night chill.
Still, several of the werewolves among them seemed to be running with a
much greater economy or ease of movement. Apart from his panting and
the pounding of his heart, Bear's Bane could make out almost no other
sounds in the gloom, except for when either he or one other who seemed
similarly inexperienced disturbed the undergrowth slightly, causing a
faint sound, with which the leader responded with a barely audible growl
of disapproval.

Reaching the top of the rise, Grigor felt a prickly sensation along his
back and a sudden shiver of breeze. Somehow, he knew that they had just
entered into the territory of the Pure. All in the group seemingly felt
it, and they paused momentarily, glancing down the hill beyond. The light
of the moon filtered down faintly through the trees, providing just about
enough illumination for a wolf to see by. The leader seemed to orient
himself without much effort, and quickly led the group on with renewed
urgency. The woods here seemed somehow more ancient, more menacing...
Grigor's sweat turned colder. Any minute, he was expecting a group of
Predator Kings to materialise from behind the next tree... But the forest
remained silent. They ran on.

After quite some while, another invisible boundary seemed to be reached.
The alien territory of the Pure lay behind them, and they had returned to
normal forest. Had they gone the wrong way? Why were they going back out
of their enemy's territory? Grigor was confused, and half-exhausted, but
still he didn't question their actions. The leader of the group suddenly
slowed up, glanced around, and sniffed at the air, before leading the
oversized wolves to the foot of an overhang, where the undergrowth was
particularly thick. He wormed his way into a recess behind the foliage
and disappeared. The rest followed, and thus was the group hidden.

Bear's Bane crouched, waiting, and quickly regained his breath. He
glanced across to the others -- it was almost pitch black in the
hiding place, but he could smell them and hear their breathing quite
distinctly. No-one moved an inch. Grigor's wolf-face frowned slightly.
He was a warrior, so what was he doing hidden away in some dingy hole
like a coward? As he pondered this unusual situation, a group of battle
howls suddenly reverberated through the forest, from quite some distance
away. He thought he recognised Yelena's Dalu howl among the group --
they seemed to be issuing a challenge to come and fight. At last --
action! Grigor tensed himself, ready to spring up and sprint to the
battle... But his compatriots remained motionless, as if they hadn't
heard it at all. Most strange...

The waiting continued, in suspenseful silence. Again, and at irregular
intervals, Yelena's group of Dalus issued the battle howl, and each
time, none of the Urshuls responded. Grigor felt that they had waited
an age -- surely at least a couple of hours -- and was beginning to
wonder how long it would be until dawn, when the battle howls came
again. Was it his imagination, or was there this time the subtlest
change in the tone of their cries? Clearly he was not imagining it,
because the group suddenly awoke and sprang out from their hiding place.
The Urshuls ran towards the direction of the howls, back into Pure
territory, and fanned out. Grigor moved out to one side, trying to keep
in formation. He saw some of the others moving with an almost
supernatural speed, but then they would pause, so as not to disturb
their synchronous parallel approach. Now things were becoming clearer to
Grigor! Seemingly, they were to surprise the Predator Kings with a
sudden attack to the rear, or else to cut off their retreat.

==Into battle==

As the wolves darted up a hill through the black forest, spread out
in a long line, a chill suddenly went through the air and the group
halted. They all saw them: ambling down through the hill ahead of them
were a group of shadowy beings, and the cold air seemed to radiate
their menace outwards. Were these their foe? The silhouettes certainly
bore the form of wolves, almost prehistoric in their age and size.
Grigor remembered that [[Grigori]] had once told him about the ancient
and powerful spirits that were allied to the Pure, which were rumoured
to dwell in the ancient Russian forests... These great black wolf
spirits hissed at the air and began to tumble down through the forest
towards them. The group of Forsaken responded immediately, sprinting to
one side in an attempt to circumvent them. Half of them now raced with
unrestricted speed, so fast that their legs were almost a blur. Bear's
Bane looked on with envy -- he had heard that some Forsaken were
blessed with the legendary speed of Father Wolf, and clearly it was
true! He would have to ask one of them about it later -- assuming he
made it out alive, that was...

Those with speed far in advance of Grigor's managed to outrun and
evade the primeval wolf-spirits, and vanished into the forest ahead in
a blur, presumably to rejoin their compatriots in battle as planned.
This left the slower Urshuls in the group, Grigor and two others, to
face the spirits alone.

There seemed to be four of them, seemingly mighty shadows of Gauru-
wolves from forgotten nightmares. One of the three Urshuls, Stone Jaws,
growled to Grigor that he should hold back and take them from the side.
He and the other, Curses-in-Riddles, then dashed forward into battle,
darting in between their four opponents, so as to disrupt their defense
and attack from an unexpected direction. A chaos of growls, screams, and
jostling wolves resulted. Bear's Bane waited no longer and sprinted
forward and to one side, where a small rocky outcropping conveniently
overlooked the battle. He sprang up onto it, and, without hesistation,
stretched his hind legs in a great leap... The flying Rahu landed on the
back of one of the unsuspecting spirits who was about to strike at
Curses-in-Riddles, digging his claws into its shoulders and his Urshul
jaws into its neck. The thing screamed and shook Grigor off, but the
damage had been done -- blood-essence spurted from an artery in its neck.
Curses-in-Riddles seized this opportunity and darted in for the killing
blow. The thing shattered into shards of nothingness.

Grigor's interjection had turned the tide of the fight in their favour,
but Stone Jaws had been left to deal with two opponents alone. There
was a great snapping blow, and a roar of pain from his direction...
Grigor and Anton -- Curses-in-Riddles -- quickly set about taking on
one opponent each. It was a short, brutal, fight, but they slightly
outmatched their enemies, at least in tenacity and reserves, albeit not
in size and strength. As the bloodied Forsaken struck their
discorporating blows, they turned to see how Stone Jaws, with a
desperate last-gasp effort, leap at his foe in an all-out attack. The
two forms rolled on the ground, howling, and the spirit was extinguished.
They had won.

The two relatively uninjured Forsaken approached Stone Jaws. His fur
was matted with blood, although he still stood defiantly, gasping for
breath. One of his hind legs was badly wounded, however, perhaps even
broken, and he walked with a pronounced limp. Clearly, he wouldn't be
able to get to the battle in time, and Grigor guessed that he had
already used up his reserves of essence. Curses-in-Riddles asked what
they could do to help, but Stone Jaws rebuffed him, growling harshly.
Anton hesistated for a brief moment, before sprinting away, leaving
Grigor alone with the lame Urshul-wolf. &quot;You too, Bear's Bane,&quot; he
panted in First Tongue, spitting out blood. &quot;Go! What are you waiting
for?!&quot; Grigor hesitated... Surely he couldn't leave his injured
compatriot alone here in Pure territory? It was highly questionable
whether he would be able to make it out alive... But if Grigor stayed
to help, perhaps his chances would be better? After all, he owed him
that much, after Stone Jaws had effectively sacrificed himself in
battle, by taking the brunt of the attack.

He stared at the lame, bloodied wolf, and for a moment or two no words
were exchanged. Grigor seemed to notice a weary glossiness in the
other's eyes, just the same as in the defeated eyes of the deer that
Grigor had felled in the last pack hunt... or was it just his
imagination? Stone Jaws spoke again, gasping to spit out the words.
&quot;The pack needs you. Go! Leave me here! The Pure are more dangerous
even than the foe we have just faced... Go, God curse you!&quot; Grigor
hesistated for another moment, in an agony of indecision, before
responding, &quot;Good luck. May Mother Luna watch over you.&quot; He sprang away
up the hillside, leaving Stone Jaws to an uncertain fate.

Bear's Bane now had to catch up, or he would miss the fight, and,
although he was unlikely to be the most accomplished fighter in the
group, the others would still be weakened by his absence! He raced
through the trees, following Anton's scent from half a minute ago, all
thoughts of stealth discarded. Distantly, he heard crashes and howls
of battle... He caught a brief glimpse of his leader, already way
ahead, sprinting down a slope to cross a brook. Grigor noticed a
potential short cut, a fallen tree branch atop a rise. He could make
it to the other side more quickly, but it would have to be a mighty
leap indeed... He steeled himself and sprang across the gap of many
metres. The tree trunk crashed into the stream below, but Grigor was
across, and he was now hot on the heels of Curses-in-Riddles. The
two Forsaken made it to the top of the hill. Ahead in a clearing were
lights, and the sounds of battle rang out clearly. Among the roars
were almost impossibly deep and menacing growls. The Predator Kings
had arrived.

==A lesson in violence==

His heart thumping, Grigor raced to the edge of an indeterminate area
mostly bereft of trees, dimly lit by the scattered light of the several
torches which the Dalu group of Bear Hunters had seemingly thrust into
the ground in order to demarcate their chosen battle area. The Rahu was
momentarily overwhelmed by the chaos of sounds and scents: growls,
clashes, gunfire, howls, blood, smoke, burning flesh, gunpowder. He was
dimly aware as Curses-in-Riddles dashed off to one side and leaped onto
the back of a mighty-looking Predator King Dalu. Grigor glanced around
in a moment of indecision... Ahead of him in the clearing one Forsaken
was being overwhelmed by a pair of formidable-looking Pure Urshuls.
He looked like he would soon be vanquished, but Grigor was not at all
sure that he would be able to take them by himself. To his left he
noticed a Pure Urhan creeping through the undergrowth to sneak up on
what, judging from his scent, Grigor presumed to be one of the Forsaken
armed with rifles, who had hidden himself. Slightly further off in the
other direction, Melody-of-Iron was battling against a giant Dalu
wielding an mighty axe. It was difficult to judge the progress of her
fight, but she was bleeding from several wounds... Grigor had to make a
decision, and quickly!

Momentarily orienting himself behind the sneaking Urhan, he shifted
his vocal cords to human form and yelled out &quot;One sneaking Pure!
Shoot in this direction!&quot; The Urhan immediately shifted to Urshul,
however, and sprang to one side. Grigor was already sprinting away
when he heard the sharp crack of a rifle behind him. He couldn't tell
what had happened, but he hoped at least that he had prevented the hunter
from being ambushed. Other than that, the guy with the rifle would have
to look out for himself!

Grigor bunched his muscles and raced into the clearing towards Yelena's
opponent. Tensing himself, he let out a roar and sprang onto the Predator
King Dalu, brutally ripping at its shoulders with his Urshul jaws. The
thing let out a bestial howl and eventually managed to shake him off, but
it had been enough of a diversion. Despite her wounds, Yelena didn't
hesitate to seize the opportunity -- she darted inside the Dalu's defenses
and slammed her axe squarely into its chest with surprising force. It let
out a horrific howl-scream, coughing up blood, and toppled to the ground.
One down.

Melody-of-Iron only gave him the briefest of glances -- he couldn't
read her expression, but, as ever, she didn't seem too pleased -- before
sprinting over to the waylaid Forsaken that Grigor had noticed earlier.
Grigor was only a step or two behind her, but they seemed to have
arrived a moment too late -- the Forsaken had just slumped to the ground,
motionless. One of the Pure Urshuls, fresh blood dripping from its
fangs, stepped over the body, about to rend it in two, when it was
stopped by Grigor's ominous warning growl. The two Pure Urshuls whirled
around with a wicked snarl to face the two oncoming Blood Talons. Yelena
let out a furious battle cry and engaged the more fearsome-looking Predator
King, leaving Grigor to take on the other. Had his opponent been unwounded,
it would have been a daunting foe, but it was already suffering from a wide
gash in its torso, presumably inflicted by the fallen Forsaken. As Grigor
moved in, there was the cracking boom of a nearby rifle shot as his
opponent took a bullet squarely in the back. Bear's Bane smashed into him
with a mighty attack, and the two Urshuls blurred in a frenzy of jaws, fur,
and claws. Given the weakend state of his opponent, it didn't take Grigor
too long to prevail, and he closed his jaws on his enemy's neck with a
killing blow.

There was no time to celebrate this easy victory, however, as next to
him Yelena was engaged in a fight to the death against the Urshul-from-Hell.
It would take their combined might to defeat him... Bear's Bane
was already weary and bleeding, but he ground his teeth in determination
and let rip with a battle howl. He felt the ecstacy of battle rise within
him and a new strength and vigour suddenly flowed through his veins. His
muscles bunched, stretched, and grew, and his fangs extended into a
nightmarish maw... The Gauru-Grigor smashed into the fight with the
Predator King alongside Yelena. With the red mist of battle-fury, he
didn't remember much of the epic conflict, although he was dimly aware of
how Yelena was cleverly probing at their opponent with her battle-spear,
so as to leave an opening for the Gauru, which he exploited with maximum
violence. The Predator King struck back at his two attackers valiantly,
but he seemed to be unprepared for the unusual combination of cautious
and probing Dalu, alongside battle-crazed Gauru... After an epic struggle,
Yelena managed to pin the beast with her spear and Grigor leaped onto it
from behind, pushing it onto the shaft with inexorable force. Its body
sagged as the spear punched straight through its chest, snapping, and
Grigor's Gauru jaws closed on its neck.

Victory howls echoed throughout the clearing, and the last thing Grigor
remembered was his ecstatic Gauru howl joining them... The red mist
cleared and Bear's Bane came to his senses, in Dalu form. A wave of pain,
fatigue, and nausea suddenly crashed over him and he slumped to his knees.
As the other Forsaken, still finishing their victory cries, began to
assemble and assess the situation, Grigor was still half-slumped on the
ground, gasping for air and coughing up blood with a grimace. At the edge
of the clearing he caught a brief glance of one of the wounded Predator
Kings in retreat...

==The price of victory==

Three of the Predator Kings had been slain in all, but the Forsaken had
lost one of their number, Hawk-Eye, the one who had fallen before Grigor
and Yelena's final opponents. Grigor looked down at his body solemnly.
Should he have helped him sooner? Perhaps if he had come straight to
his aid, he could have been saved? But then, could Grigor have held off
the two Pure by himself? Unlikely, and then maybe Yelena might not have
prevailed against her opponent... As he was pondering this and still
wearily regaining his breath, some of the other Bear Hunters began
cutting the canine teeth from the bodies of the Pure.

They returned down the hill, back to their original gathering place.
Grigor helped to carry the body of Hawk-Eye. Building up the fire again,
a ritual was started; as far as Grigor could tell, it seemed to be some
kind of victory ceremony dedicated to Fenris-Ur. After about half an
hour of this, three of the Pure canine teeth were offered up in
chiminage, leaving three remaining. Wolf-spirits materialised around the
fire -- servants of Fenris-Ur, perhaps?

It seemed that the three remaining teeth were to be given as a trophy to
those among them deemed most valiant. Each in turn named the Forsaken
that he or she thought most worthy, no-one naming themselves. The fallen
Hawk-Eye was named once, and there were murmurs of approval. Grigor
also heard Melody-of-Iron's name at least twice. When it came to his
turn, Grigor was heartened to notice that a latecomer had arrived at the
gathering, a still limping Dalu, walking with the aid of a makeshift
wooden crutch. &quot;Stone Jaws&quot;, Grigor called out, nominating the Forsaken
from the earlier fight against the spirits, and the other nodded slightly
at him in acknowledgement.

After the trophies had been dealt out, as dawn slowly broke, Red-Beard
gave a solemn funeral speech for Hawk-Eye. The body was lifted onto a
small bier of gathered wood, and petrol was poured over it. During the
cremation, each of the Forsaken stood forward in turn to say a few words
in honour of their fallen colleague. After most had had their say, the
glances of the dozen werewolves fell upon Grigor. He stepped forward and
took a deep breath, uncertain of what to say. The Rahu had never been
big on speeches, so he struggled to summon forth his new-found ability
to say the right words... &quot;Hawk-Eye, unlike most here, I never had
the honour of knowing you, nor of fighting alongside you, and I will ever
be the poorer for that. I wish only that I could have arrived a moment
or two sooner, so as to be able to join you in your great battle, and
share in your glory.&quot; Grigor paused for a moment. &quot;As for you as a man -
and as one of the Forsaken, one of the Bear Hunters, I leave to the
others here who knew you better -- older and wiser -- and to the spirits
-- to judge your qualities. But I will say this: You fell in a way that
any Blood Talon would be proud of, fighting to the last, against the
bitterest of foes, giving your all. Without your sacrifice, others would
doubtless have fallen in your stead. When my time comes, I should like
to have my end as you have had yours. Know also that I avenged you.
Farewell brother.&quot;

In the pale light of the autumn dawn, the remaining Bear Hunters stood
in silence as the bier burnt down to ashes. Each then made their way
home alone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2777">The Crimson Tears claim the former territory of [[Rote Wut]] to the south of the [[Shadowclaws]]. They were founded by [[Die Amazone]], the last member of the Rote Wut. They favour a different approach though: Where Rote Wut was known for its brutality and rejection of the [[alliance]], the Crimson Tears are a part of it and seem to be more open to dialogue.

The Shadowclaws have a favour remaining from [[die Amazone]] for letting the pack use their locus. They also helped out in a fight once, so relations seem to be quite good. In a [[Breeding Grounds|recent]] attack by the Pure, die Amazone was killed. Speaks-for-the-dead has taken the favour she owed the Shadowclaws.

Since then, Boneblade has taken the Role of Alpha, and the pack has again taken a more rejective stance towards the [[alliance]], not showing up on any meetings except for the [[In memory of Amazone|obituary]] of its former alpha. Still, they have not formally declared that they leave the alliance. The pack's leadership seems to rest mostly on Sergei and Arja, and both are not very open for dialogue with werewolves outside the pack. The Crimson Tears have made it clear they will kill trespassers, but unlike Rote Wut have also stated they will stick to their territory - and they seem to have observed this.

The totem of the [[Crimson Tears]] is said to be the spirit of a certain building in their territory, where the pack regularly meets. Rumour says its a bar (with illegal fights in the basement), but this is not confirmed and so far noone wanted to draw their anger by investigating matters of the pack.

Right now, it is on the far end of the no man's land to the west of the pack's territory.

It is known for its beautiful romantic scenery, and often visited by young couples in love, or those who hope to become such. It is surrounded by an artfully worked iron fence. The park has been restored to its old beauty in the second half of the seventeenth century, after much of it had been destroyed in a flooding. Still, many people claim that the older park was even more beautiful - although there is certainly no-one alive who has seen it with his own eyes, as the park was destroyed.

The park has a certain air that is very calming, and there is a local legend that if you entrust the name of a person you truly love to the wind in the park on a rainy night, you will be given the key to her heart. The park is locked at dusk, but police usually turns a blind eye to those who climb the fence on rainy nights.

The [[Summer Gates|main gate]] to the park appears to be a [[:Category: Locus|locus]] of yet undetermined attunement. The spirit world still shows the park in the night of the flooding more than 200 years ago.

It is located right next to the [[Summer Garden]]. The correct name is actually 'victims of the revolution square', though noone uses it.

There is an eternal flame in the center of the large place, as a reminder of the victims of the 1917 revolution. There is also a number of statues of russia's greatest generals. The field had many uses during the history of the city, the longest (and name-giving) being a military parade ground from the end of 18th to early 20th century.

The spirit world of the place looks almost like an arena, the ground strewn with sand, large braziers burning in the corners. As the pack could [[The fate of The Bleeding Stone|experience]] first-hand, a number of warlike spirits live here, taking the form of ancient warrior statues. They are most likely linked to Mars and the concept of a warrior, though little is known.

[[wod:Cahalith|Cahalith]], alpha of the [[Crimson Tears]] and former member of [[Rote Wut]], both packs to the south of the [[Shadowclaws]]' territory. She used to wear practical clothing. In wolf form, her grey fur sported a number of ritual tatoos and drawings.

She was involved in the [[Battle against Rote Wut|fighting]] between Rote Wut and the players, where she succesfully stirred unrest in the south of the player's territory, and tried to kill [[Edouard Lambert]]. She almost managed to achieve the latter goal before she realised her dreams had been poisoned by Rabid Wolf, totem of the [[wod:Fire-Touched|Fire-Touched]]. One of these pure had infiltrated their pack, trying to create unrest so the Forsaken would weaken themselves enough for the pure to retake the city. 

After she realised her mistake, she helped the pack kill the pure werewolf and fight the consequences of her actions. She vanished after the victory, but returned a few month later at the head of a new pack. She also joined the [[wod:Storm Lords|Iminir]] tribe.

She was a capable warrior and had a lot of experience in prophetic visions, though her failure to see through the deceptions of Rabid Wolf made her hesitant to share it. She owed the players an unspecified favour for allowing her pack to use a safe locus in the reconquest of her territory.

She was [[Breeding Grounds|slain]] by [[Whitefang]], an Ivory Claw, reportedly while saving the life of [[Sergei Grigorovich|Boneblade]]. In a [[In memory of Amazone|memorial]], she was praised by several werewolves for her accomplishments and devotion to her pack.

victim. ''His'' victim, in a sense. ''Ruthlessness'', Angus
thought, comes too easily, especially after a few tries. All
those times he was taught &quot;you cannot value a life&quot;, &quot;you cannot
compare the worth a two lives&quot;? Of course you can, it's very
simple. Kill one and save a hundred? Easy question, for an
Uratha. He'd kill to save lives, any time. Or not. Kill
[[Victor Flammendes-Schwert|Victor]] and save a hundred? That's more tricky. But still,
you can place a value on life. Victor's life would be worth more
than 100 &quot;normal&quot; lives. Perhaps 1,000, perhaps 10,000. Point
is, you can put a price on his life. The life of that kid over
there, no more than ashes and a wooden box by now? Not worth
much. Angus had sacrificed that life for the deals with
[[She-Who-Was-Eternally-Lost]] and the [[T-34|Steel Predator
Spirit]]. And he considered those favourable deals. A few lives in
exchange for help and saving even more lives. ''Ruthlessness'',
the Storm Lord thought.

Angus heard footsteps coming up behind him. He already smelled
who it was: [[Nievo Ashkov|Nievo]], the local chief of
police. Nievo tipped Angus' shoulder: &quot;Hullo Angus... didn't
expect to see ''you'' here!&quot; Angus shrugged, and gestured
towards the funeral &quot;I... well... &quot; -- &quot;Hm, yes. Bloody waste of
life. And the accident was in the new speed limit zone, as well! You've heard?
There's talk in the city halls that they want to abolish the
speeding limits. Foolish! How can anyone ''abolish'' a speed
limit after a car accident? Even three accidents! Have you heard
anything on this in the town hall?&quot; 

The Ithaeur had. In fact, he and [[Edouard]] were the ones
responsible not only for the accidents, but also for the stop of
the speeding limits. The accidents had been easy: bind a few
spirits, let them nudge the &quot;correct&quot; behaviour in car drivers
along a certain road -- and that was
it. She-Who-Was-Eternally-Lost had wanted tragic deaths. Now she
even got a tragic death of a child, Angus thought, looking over to the funeral. They were now lowering the coffin into the grave. Getting rid
of the speed limits after that had been more tricky. He had
painstakingly avoided any direct involvement in that business. He
needed to keep a clean shirt for further contacts and promotions
in the city hall. Plus, as a foreigner, people would remember him. But
together with Edouard's business contacts, [[Grigor]]'s mafia
contacts, [[Aleksandr]]'s digging up of dirt on politicians, and
his own knowledge of the inner workings of the city hall, they
had been able to stop the speed limits. A little bribe here, a
little blackmail there, it was all too easy in this city. But
now, but he couldn't tell Nievo all this... ''Ruthlessness'',
Angus thought.

&quot;Me?&quot; Angus answered to Nievo's question. &quot;Probably even less
than you... some politicians are afraid of their own courage and
need to look as if they are doing something.&quot; Ashkov
grunted and replied: &quot;I've heard there might be something fishy about
this. It's as if someone ''wanted'' to get rid of the speeding
limits. And all those accidents within a few days, all along the
only road with the new speeding limits?&quot; -- &quot;I really don't see
any reason why anyone would ''want'' to stop the speeding
limits&quot;, Angus replied. &quot;If the mafia is trying to bribe its way
through the city hall to achieve just that... why would they even bother? They have nothing to
gain from that.&quot; He paused. &quot;I think it's just politicians doing
the only thing they can do: screw up and pretend to be working.&quot;
Nievo didn't seem fully convinced, but he had to admit the
logic. &quot;I don't know, it just feels... wrong. Just that nagging
feeling of mine.&quot;

Both men watched the procession, led by a priest, leave the
grave. Friends, family, all dressed in black. They didn't
follow. The remainder of the funeral would be a private occasion,
time for everyone who knew the boy to grieve in company. 

&quot;You know&quot;, Angus started the conversation again, &quot;you may be
right. But shouldn't you use your gut feelings to hunt, I don't
know, ''real'' thugs?&quot; -- &quot;Ha!&quot;, Nievo exclaimed. &quot;Come along,
nothing more we can do here. I'll treat you to some food. What
did you say you Scots eat that was similar to Borscht? Haggush?&quot;
Angus smiled. &quot;Haggis&quot;, he replied. 

Both men left the cemetery. Two deals, the Ithaeur thought. No
speed limits, and at least five tragic deaths. His pack had
managed to fulfill both deals with those car accidents. Killing
two birds with one stone. No, not ruthlessness, Angus thought. ''Efficiency''.

Some time ago, in some very different place, there was a pack of Uratha that had a coyote as its totem. One of the benefits for that pack was that the totem allowed the pack members to communicate with each other over some distances, and the Uratha sometimes referred to this as Coyote Intercom.

Some beings believe that traces of [https://hanners.pintsize.de/muclogs/coyoteintercom@conference.pintsize.de/ Coyote Intercom] might still linger in the spirit world and that it could be used by revealing the exact phrase &quot;Wissendes Auge der Nacht&quot; to the spirit who is guarding that place.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1426">A locus is a powerful place where the gauntlet is very thin. As a result, essence is generated, and crossing between the material and spirit world is far easier (for many beings, it is only possible at loci).

Therefore, loci are focus points of supernatural conflict in the world of werewolf: Spirits and werewolves seek them as power bases, and others might be drawn here due to their resonance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1341">A bit to the east of the immigrant quarter in the south of Admiralteyski lies a [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolaus-Marine-Kathedrale cathedral], inside a small park. The park and lower part of the cathedral are open during daytime, while the upper, more magnificient part is only open during certain festive days of the orthodox church.

The lock on the upper door was [[The fate of The Bleeding Stone|found broken]] when Grigor pursued a Ridden here. As the pack informed the authorities, this has probably been mended by now.

The park's fence is not very high, leading homeless people to sometimes seek shelter in the park. There has been a series of reported disappearances of these people, yet noone seems to care enough to investigate.

After the [[Breeding Grounds|death]] of one of the workers here, the entrance to the church and the park had been barred, but recently both where reopenend to the public.

Beneath the cathedral, behind a brick wall, lie extensive cellars, former home to a strange breed of [[Rahglu|spirit wasps]]. There is also a [[old altar|locus]] here, now property of [[She-Who-Was-Eternally-Lost]]. The cellars have been closed temporarily due to privacy concerns, but are on the list of places where measurements for the subway constructions have to be taken.

He seems to function somewhat as a lorekeeper of the [[Enlightened]] lodge.

Dima carries a staff which seems to have the same effects as a spear on spirits, shattering their shadowbodies on impact.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4028">[[Nadja]] still did not know what to make of [[Angus|him]]. Every time
he entered her life, it turned out for the worse. Every single time he
showed up, she lost someone dear to her. 

But now? With her grandfather gone, there was no-one left he could
take away. Yet he still showed up, just like now. Nadja's doorbell had
rung, she had opened and there he stood. &quot;Can I come in?&quot;, Angus
asked. Nadja steped aside and let him into her run-down apartment. 

&quot;I have something for you&quot;, he said while pulling something out of his
pocket. A small, furry something. At first she thought it's one of
those lucky charms: tacky and without any purpose. But that wouldn't
be him... On second sight, she realised that what he handed her was
not a lucky charm, but an actual, real rabbit's foot! Nadja shuddered,
as she accepted the foot. She had seen more strange things than that. 

&quot;Look,&quot; Angus started, &quot;I know you've seen some pretty strange
things. I also know that you can look out for yourself. I've seen
that. This is... it's not to tell you that you can't look after
yourself. It's more of a... backup option. Should you ever break this,
no, should it ever break, no matter the means, I will know so
instantly. And I'll assume you are in trouble. So don't use it
frivolously.&quot; 

Nadja looked at the foot more closely. It was an actual rabbit's foot,
but was stiff and dry. She carefully bent it a bit. It would break,
but not that easily, she thought. This must be another one of those
magic things. Although Angus got rather cross when she called them by
that name. &quot;These are not magic. They are Spirits, bound by ancient
pacts. They have a purpose, and a will of their own! If you don't hold
them in reverence, they will stop working -- if you're lucky!&quot;, he
would always say.

&quot;How will you know that I am in trouble?&quot; she asked. &quot;I won't. But
once this thing is broken, it's gone. So I'll just assume you'll be in
trouble if you used it.&quot; He looked at her and added &quot;And I'll stop everything I'm doing to find
you.&quot; Not everything, Nadja thought bitterly. But close enough. &quot;And
how will you find me? I could be anywhere in this city. Or even
beyond!&quot; Angus leaned back, scratching his beard. &quot;I can find you. The
closer you are, the easier it is.&quot; He didn't add &quot;we
''[[Shadowclaws|all]]'' can find you&quot;, but Nadja suspected that
anyway.

She didn't know why he cared. No-one so far had cared for her. Not her
parents, who had ignored her at best, hit her at worst. Not her
friends, who had just used her and dumped her once her utility had
worn off. Not her previous boyfriends, who had used her for a few fun
nights in bed. Not even her grandfather; She knew her grandfather
loved her, but he had been too obsessed by that [[the old werewolf's last play|mirror thing]], too mad already. In the end, even ''he''
hadn't cared what happened to her. But why did Angus care?  Sometimes
she had the feeling it was only out of a strange and twisted sense of
duty. That he didn't care from his heart, but from his pride. Better
than nothing, she would then always think. Did he really care about
her now? Nadja couldn't tell.

Nadja took the foot and attached it to her keyring. There was even a
tiny hook for that on the foot, she saw. She didn't need any of these,
Nadja thought. Angus was right, she could look after herself. But he'd
probably get cross if she didn't take this thing with her. &quot;I have
more of those, if you need any&quot;, Angus said to her. Great. Just what
she needed. Even more protection. 

Angus stood up and cleared his throat. &quot;Anyway... if you need anything
else, just tell me. You want to do anything this weekend? I've
probably got some time...&quot; Angus went slowly towards the door. He has
never asked if he could sleep here, Nadja thought. He never even tried
to come near to her. Was that his ploy? Did other women fall for that? 

Angus was already at the door, opening it and going outside. Nadja
went to the door and stopped him. &quot;Want to stay over night?&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1447">Sergej Grigorovich, a Rahu of the pack [[Crimson Tears]], is only a few month from his first change. Prior, he served in the russian military - now, that is no longer an option. Not very talkative, he clearly functions as the muscle of the pack, and still has a lot to learn about the problems that come with his newfound power. 

His Shadowname, 'Boneblade', stems from a knife made of the bones of his father, also a werewolf, which he always carries along. His father fell in a battle against the Pure near Petersburg, about two years ago. The knife is very likely some sort of fetish, though its powers are unknown.

Sergej has on several occasions shown his contempt for werewolves outside his pack, in particular the [[Shadowclaws]]. When [[die Amazone]] died to save his life, he [[In memory of Amazone|made a promise]]: He carved the name of the Cahalith's killer, [[Whitefang]], into his right arm, swearing to not the scar heal before he'd avenged her.

Sergej took up the role of alpha afterwards. Since his feelings towards non-pack werewolves are no secret, it was assumed that he would break with the alliance sooner rather than later. For some reason, this has not happened yet.

After his packmate [[Arja Haajanen]] decreed in front of court that [[Shuro Koshonin]] was right to kill their packmate [[Taras Mihailov]], he left without swearing revenge. He has not been seen since then.

He initially intended to join the Storm Lords, but has very recently failed their trials, thus remaining a Ghost Wolf.

He was killed by [[Shuro Koshonin]] after discovering some kind of secret in the territory of [[Glasfelle]].

She previously belonged to another pack, but little else is known.

Arja Haajanen owes the [[Shadowclaws]] one unspecified favour, a duty taken over from [[die Amazone]] upon her death.

Arja has shown that she lacks a bit of touch with reality, perhaps being to obsessed with her study of the mystic and the balance of spirits, ghosts and mortals. Practical thinking seems to be one of her weak points.

He is quite willing to give advice to young members of his tribe - but a lot more hesitant to actually step in and help. He always states the oppinion that no pack deserves a territory they can't conquer on their own.

Boris is known to have little regard of the [[alliance]], but going along with the designs by his alpha. He is a solitary werewolf and leads the [[Blood Seekers]] lodge, dedicated to find a fight that truly challenges him.

Grigor has sought him out for assistance on occasion. He is also an accomplished boxer. Boris fights in Urshul form, and is quite likely the best solitary fighter among the Forsaken of Petersburg and its surroundings.

The Cahalith of the pack is a dreamer, renowned among Cahalunim for her accurate visions. It is known that she is often on long trips through the Hisil, though noone can tell what exactly she is doing there.
She frequently misses meetings of the [[alliance]], so most members of other packs don't even know what she looks like.

'Klang des Asphalts' is little known outside the pack, which is usually represented by Yelena or Vanya. She seems to be quite at home in the Hisil, making sure the shadow side of the packs territory stays clean.

She fights with a fetish longsword that she can draw out of nowhere in the Hisil, a blade she seems quite adapt with. The pack has yet to hear her speaking a word.

The area has [[Fight in the sewers|seen]] [[Battle against Rote Wut|much]] [[The old werewolf's last play|trouble]] recently, and is generally in a bad shape - many buildings are run-down, and there is no place for young people to meet.

The ground floor of the youth club features a large area where the youth can meet and drink (non-alcoholic!) beverages. The top floor has some sparsely furnished sleeping rooms, where young people can stay for a night if they have trouble at home. The cellar houses three 'hobby rooms', one of which is outfitted with an improvised boxing ring used by [[Grigor]] for 'self-confidence through self-defence' sessions. Another has a few outdated gym machines, while the third is empty except for a large table.

There is a staff of social workers employed - an addition provided by [[Vanka Iosiforna]] - such that at all times there are at least two persons who can tend to the youth, and make sure everything stays within bounds.

The club is used by the local mafia for recruiting suitable teenagers (lack of inhibitions, strength and willingness to obey being the main criteria). Grigor runs this operation since the mafia assigned him the post a while ago. He has since recruited about a dozen young lads, referred to as the [[Foreign Legion]] since none of them are native russians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1398">Menatep Saint Petersburg Commercial Bank is one of the leading investment banks in Saint Petersburg, with an old tradition. It's foundation reaches back into the 19th century, when it was established as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wawelberg Wawelberg Bank]. After the revolution, the bank temporarily moved to Poland, but returned during Soviet times.

After a crisis in the 1990s, when the bank came under investigation by the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Action_Task_Force_on_Money_Laundering FATF] for money laundering and financing criminal activities, the bank has emerged strengthened by the fall of the iron curtain, and is now one of the primary investors in Saint Petersburg's growing economy, providing loans for new projects, mergers, and expansions.

The bank is managed by a board of directors with 8 members, one of which is [[Edouard]], who has the role of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Investment_Officer Chief Investment officer].

The headquarters is housed in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wawelberg_Bank_building Wawelberg Bank building], in the centre of Saint Petersburg, close to the [[Church of our Saviour on the Blood]]. The old building has a renovated, modern interior, and Edouard's office is on the top floor. There is a permanent security guard at the entrance, and a magnetic card is needed for entrance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1232">The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Savior_on_Blood Church of our Saviour on the Blood] is one of the most famous churches in Russia. It is build on the spot where Tsar Aleksandr II of Russia was mortally wounded in an assassination by anarchists. The Church's architecture is unique in the city, as it was build in the style of older churches.

The church was long closed to the public, used as a warehouse from 1917 to the mid-60's, when it was dubbed 'Church of our Saviour on Potatoes', a name still used by less religious citizens. It has since been restored to its former splendour, and is a major tourist attraction. Religious services resumed in the 70's, and the crypt is currently renovated. It houses the remains of Aleksandr II and a number of other important russian nobles, and is closed to the public.

The pack suspected that the [[Roter Hof|Red Court]] is somehow tied to the church, but investigations run into a dead end when they heard the crypt was completely shut off, the key to the mighty iron gates resting with the [[Dorofey Evgenikov|episcop]] of Saint Petersburg, on old man unwilling to let anyone into the 'unspoiled sanctum of our mother church'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="809">Dorofey Evgenikov ist the episcop - the orthodox equivalent of a bishop - of St. Petersburg. He is 92 years old, and quite frail. There is widespread belief that he is no longer capable of carrying out his duties, and that the churches in St. Petersburg suffer from neglect and bad management. Dorofey is usually not seen in public, for health reasons.

Nominally, Dorofey is still the priest responsible for [[Saint Isaac Cathedral]], but due to his failing health there have not been services at the cathedral since some years.

It is to be expected that, should Dorofey finally die, his replacement will have some impact on the church in Saint Petersburg - and the most important churches in the city are located in the area to the east of the [[Shadowclaws]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="808">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Isaac%27s_Cathedral Saint Isaac's Cathedral] is the largest church building in Saint Petersburg, seat of the city's [[Dorofey Evgenikov|epsicop]] and a famous symbol of the glory of Imperial Russia. The church is named after the patron saint of Peter the Great himself.

The building was closed after the second world war, and turned into a museum of atheism by the Soviet regime. Only after the fall of the iron curtain was it reopened, and service resumed - although only in a small side chapel, because the episcop's health does not permit him performing service in the richly decorated main hall.

Recently, the building has been closed to the public and visitors, to allow measurements for the construction of a subway line.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1388">A branch of the city administration, concerned with preservation of the many historical buildings in the city - and making money out of them via tourism. The branch is chronically short on cash, but since this is true for almost any branch of the city administration (safe the Vodka-related ones, probably), it seems to function quite well.

The branch also oversees restauration work on old buildings, a never-ending task in a historically important site as St Petersburg. [[Grigori]] joined the branch some time after his return. He currently works as a conservator, and as a supervisor to the underpaid workers the branch enlists for its projects. The offices of the branch are located in the city center, in a very new building on Nevsky project. The lower floor is public accesible, and serves as a tourist information. Every member is required to spend a few hours here each week, though no one likes to, and these hours are commonly traded among the clerks as a sort of currency.

Currently, the branch is hopelessly overstrained by the extension of the city's [[St Petersburg Underground|subway system]], undertaking statical measurements on the cellars of the old buildings and trying to locate spots where a caved-in structure might have previously stood - an almost impossible task due to the lack of archives from the pre-soviet era.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1272">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg_Metro Saint Petersburg Underground] is the subway system of Saint Petersburg. Built in the Soviet era, most stations are renowned for majestic construction. In recent years, the system has replaced the tram system as the major form of public transport. With the planned addition of more station, this trend is likely to continue.

There are no stations beyond the territory claimed by the [[Shadowclaws]], though some are planned, and the unclaimed land to the east has the central stations where most lines cross.

After a failed attempt at introducing a general speed limit of 30 kmh in the city center, the authorities seem determined to expand the system, adding a number of new stations, one of which would lie in the territory of the Shadowclaws. However, due to intricacies with the extensive cellars of many of the old buildings in the city center and the prominence of underground cavities and rivers in the area, work is unlikely to begin anytime soon.

The company operating the system, privatised after the fall of the iron curtain, is currently in dispute with the [[St Petersburg Cultural Heritage Authority]] due to their expansion plans affecting some old buildings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2368">The Eristoffs are an old family of Wolfblooded in [[Petersburg]]. Their origin is not currently known, but they seem to have served the Ivory Claws as breeding material, producing Pure with a 'clean' heritage. The family was very strictly organised and quite loyal to the Pure, if only out of fear of retaliation. It was known in the area that one shouldn't ask too many questions about them - several people had disappeared.

Apparently, when Petersburg was [[The Legend of the Lodge of Enlightened|conquered]] by the Forsaken, the Pure told the family to keep its heads down, as they would be back soon. Amazingly, the threat of the Pure returning (and, perhaps, the advantages of a strictly-run family business) where enough to keep the family a secret for almost a decade.

When the [[Shadowclaws]] [[Breeding Grounds|recently]] stumbled upon the Eristoffs, the Ivory Claws were alarmed by the threat to the 'pure blood' of the family, and attacked. The attack was beaten back with losses on both [[Die Amazone|sides]], though the Pure managed to abduct three of five branches of the family.

They then settled on destroying the rest, leaking all information about the business and its illegal practices to the police. This lead to the arrest of Ioann, a family head. With the help of [[Edouard]], he managed to convince the court that he alone was responsible, avoiding further arrests in the family.

During the first change of [[Ilya Eristoff]], the pack finally managed to convince Ilpati, the last remaining head, that the Ivory Claws where no longer in power, and that the so-called 'traitors' were actually more benevolent. It has to be seen how the fate of the family will develop in the future.

As he is now included into Forsaken society and a member of the [[Crimson Tears]], he certainly has an interesting future before him.

He is on good terms with [[Edouard]], due to the Cahalith's involvement with his former family; this is one of the few ties between the [[Shadowclaws]] and the Crimson Tears and might prove valuable in the future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1409">A strange breed of spirit and flesh, the Rhaglu appear as sheep-sized wasps. Little is known about them, and it took Angus days to find their name even with help of the [[Enlightened]]. The few facts that are known are:

* They are not Spirits (at least not fully). The Ithalunim did not even know the names of them. 
* They seem to posses strength in numbers. A lone Rhaglu is weak, but when the [[Shadowclaws|pack]] was [[Breeding Grounds|ambushed]] by 7 of them it was almost wiped out.
* They have a hive-like structure, as there are many underneath [[St. Nicholaus Cathedral]]. At least 3 types exist: Simple 'workers' wo make up the majority, fierce warriors wo seem primarily concerned with protecting the nest, and queens which probably function as some sort of hive mind, as she is not needed for laying eggs.
* They procreate by laying eggs into humans, which then hatch within about a month, consuming their hosts. They favour wolfblooded since these have a higher-than-average stamina, allowing for more eggs to successfully hatch. All workers can lay eggs, not only the queen.
* They have a basic understanding of human society, hiding their victims and acting as to not draw too much attention.
* They seem to communicate based on scent, and supernaturally strong odours are known to disrupt their unity, making them far easier to battle.

      <comment>added important fact about Arja</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4547">The gathering of the [[alliance]] had gone on for a while. They had discussed the reasons behind the [[Breeding Grounds|attack]] by the Ivory Claws, and what they could do against such incursions. When all was said and done, [[Victor Flammendes-Schwert]] took a step forward and a deep breath.

''It is with a sad heart that I have to announce the loss of a Forsaken in the attack by the Pure. Her funeral rite has already been held, but I think she deserves respect also from outside her pack. Anyone who knew her may now speak freely, reminding us of what we lost.''

He paused only briefly, then went on.

''Die Amazone was a good example to all of us. She went through a corruption by Rabid Wolf, but in the decisive moment she noticed it, [[Battle against Rote Wut|turning]] the tide. She went on to build a new pack, and no doubt did more than her due in reconquering her former territory for the [[Crimson Tears]]. I will always remember her as an example of how much can be achieved by strength of will alone. She will be missed.''

Others, mostly Storm Lords, stepped forwards, offering similar words. When the turn came to her packmates, [[Arja Haajanen]] was the first to step forward. It was the first words she had ever spoken outside her pack.

''Most of you don't know me, but one thing you know should suffice: Die Amazone was my alpha. It was her who gave my life a new meaning when I thought I had lost everything. It was her strength that fused us together. She always led from the front, never requiring a sacrifice from one of us without giving an equal one herself. It was there that she found her death, saving the life of a packmate. It was the way she would have wanted to die. Still, I feel that one thing is still left in this life, a debt she would have wanted settled.''

She turned towards [[Angus]].

''She owed your pack a favour, and she was never one to renege from a promise. Know that this favour now rests on my shoulders. You can call it in anytime you like.''

There was mumbling among the audience - such a thing was very rare among werewolves. Then the crowd quickly fell silent as [[Sergei Grigorovich|Boneblade]] stepped forward, his dagger in the right hand, his left clenched to a fist.

''I am not known for my words. I am also not known for my wisdom. Probably I deserve either reputation. Die Amazone certainly doesn't. She saved my life when I lay there bleeding on the concrete, waiting for my certain death at the hands of the Pure. She paid a high price for it. I will never forget her, nor what she taught us as an alpha.''

He raised the left fist into the air as he spoke, illuminating his arm. It was scarred with symbols from First Tongue.

''I have carved the name of her killer into my flesh. Know that I will not rest before her death is avenged!''

The fresh scar shone clear and bright in the dimly lit room. It spelled a name, [[Whitefang]].

The last werewolf to speak was Angus. As he took a step forward, he could see the barely restrained rage in the eyes of Boneblade. He knew it too well from his own packmate, [[Grigor]]. Well, you can't please everyone, Angus thought. We'll have to watch our backs again, with that Rahu on the loose south of our territory...

''I -- we -- have known Die Amazone for a long time. At first, we were neighbours, peace held only with an uneasy truce. Tensions mounted, and imprudent actions were taken.'' Angus gave Grigor a stern look. ''Then, war broke out. Without Die Amazone, I think I can confidently say that we would not be standing here today. We managed to find a way to bury our differences, and we gained a new packmember whilst doing so. Uneasy truce, war, peace, and even if not friendship, then deep understanding and support. Without Die Amazone, that chain of events would have stopped at &quot;war&quot;. We owe her more than we ever cared to admit. With her dead, we lose more than we can currently imagine.''

After the meeting, Angus caught up with Speaks-to-the-dead.

''As you now carry the burden of die Amazone, you should also carry her benefits. I have experience with hotheaded Rahu; if you need advice, you can come to me.''

Arja turned around only briefly, but the glare in her eyes clearly showed what she thought about the offer.

''I will not take your words as an offence - not this time. You should know, though, that I would rather be ripped apart by the Pure then ever carry a matter of my pack to strangers.''

Then she turned around and left, heading back to her territory.

==Intro: Hunt==

[[Angus]] was just putting a new pot plant in the corridor of his apartment, cursing the neighbour's ever-hungry dog, as a small rabbit came running out of nowhere, across the corridor. At first he was surprised: A spirit, in this world, so blatantly showing itself to a werewolf? Then it struck him: The rabbit foot he had given to [[Nadja]] had been broken!

He was out of the building within a few seconds, calling his packmates on the cellphone. &quot;Nadja is in trouble&quot; was all he needed to say. [[Aleksandr]] picked him up with the van, [[Grigor]] and [[Grigori]] preferred their own rides. They met at her apartment, the obvious place to start a search. Angus picked up her trail in seconds -- her scent was very familiar by now. Shifting to Urhan, he was once more glad about his dogs collar. The pack set off on the trail, Angus leading the group as a big dog.

After some turns they found the discarded rabbit foot. The scent also changed: Angus could make out a note of fear on it. It was an even more familiar note, showing him once again that Nadja had not completely come to grips with their relationship and his true nature. Well, that was a problem for another day. There were other trails, but too many to make out any possible attacker or pursuer. At least there was no panic or blood, so it seemed she had escaped.

Following the trail further, the pack arrived at a night bar. They exchanged glances, then Angus and Grigori went inside while Aleksandr and Grigor covered the back door.

The club was a confusing mixture of noise, sweat and various other scents related to mating and drinking. It took them quite some time to make out Nadja. She stood at the bar, her eyes shifting rapidly over the room, as if she was looking for something. If there was any doubt before, this proofed she was being followed. Angus and Grigori set about identifying her pursuers, with Grigori finding a men who had his eyes firmly locked on the woman. He stood at the side of the dancefloor, seemingly uninterested. Grigori moved aside him, trying not to draw attention.

Meanwhile, Angus headed towards the bar. Playing drunk, he crashed into Nadja, babbling &quot;Let's go home, honey...&quot;. Nadja was not pleased, and before long, a small group of young men came to her protection, prompting Angus to leave. At the same time, Grigori noticed the man starting to move towards Nadja. He tried to stop him, but suddenly the men turned around and extended long mandibles from its mouth, sinking them into Grigori's shoulder.

Grigori managed to send a single message out: DEFCON 1. It did not take more for Grigor to act: Drawing the shotgun from under his coat, he broke the door to the back of the bar, heading for the dancefloor. A few seconds later, panic had ensued, as everyone tried to get out of the bar. Angus was caught up in the stampede and unable to make it towards the exit. [[Edouard]], still in the van, started to pursue the fleeing ridden.

Grigor and Aleksandr took the back exit and ran towards the van, trying to jump inside. Grigor made it due to his Gift, but Aleksandr ended up under the wheels of the van. Edouard, not wanting to let the strange ridden escape, drove on. Grigor drew his pistol, and they were able to easily take down the first fleeing ridden. The remaining two split up, so Grigor jumped out to pursue one, while Edouard simply drove his van into the other. When Angus and Grigori emerged from the bar, Nadja with them, the three strange attackers were already dead.

Nonetheless, the question remained what exactly they were and why they had been after the wolfblood.

==Act 1: A dark threat==

The pack started to investigate the origin of the strange creatures. Following the trail of their scent, they arrived at [[St. Nicholaus Cathedral]] in the no-mans-land between their territory and the [[Glasfelle]]. There, [[Shuro Koshonin]] was already waiting for them. He dropped out of the shadows right next to the pack.

''&quot;Ah, I see you are following trails. I am here to remind you of your promise. What you seek lies here. Remember what we discussed.&quot;''

And with that, he turned away, vanishing into the shadows after a few steps.

Using Aleksandr's and Angus' connections, the pack found out that one of the humans was from this area, and where he lived. They broke into his flat and interviewed the other residents of the building. It turned out there was a dispute in the area, also mentioned in the [[Admiralteyski Wochenblatt|local papers]]: The majority of residents where either Russian middle-class shop owners or academics, mostly foreign, who worked in the many cultural sites of Saint Petersburg. The two factions were bitter enemies and had often petitioned the owners of the building to evict the other side. The problem was that the question of ownership was unclear, as some papers were missing.

Then they found out that the attic was closed off for 'security reasons' (as there was the clear owner, no-one felt responsible for repairs), but the lock had recently been broken. When they opened the door, there was an unmistakable smell of blood and rotting flesh. Investigating, they not only found the papers of ownership (almost bleached out), but also the body of a man. It seemed to have been killed a while ago, and there were several parts missing.

Edouard met Vanka from the Glasfelle to try and get the coroner's report - the body had been taken to a hospital in their territory. He was unsuccessful at first, but then Vanka made a call. A few minutes later he had the papers. It turned out the body had been partially eaten, and belonged to a man who was missing since a few weeks ago. He had vanished near an infamous disco for richer kids, the [[Night Cafe Petersburg]], situated in a living area and regularly breaking the law by not turning down the volume at night.

Aleksandr knew the bar well. He had never been inside, but word on the street was that most of the missing people simply left for a better life, as playmates for rich Russians. Still, some odd stories had developed there. The pack decided to visit.

Meanwhile, another lead developed: It seems there was a small 'club' of young men who made a hobby investigating mysteries. Two of them had been the other two ridden, also living in the rough area. One of them had apparently heard about the strange attic, and went to investigate.

With Edouard's help, they managed to gain access to the Night Cafe Petersburg, Grigor posing as a bodyguard. Grigori managed to turn up some rumour about a strange girl from a poor family, where the turn of events was reverted: Not the girl vanished, but her lover. The girl was later seen again, and the lover turned up dead floating in the Neva. There had been no investigation, and no-one wanted to describe the girl more closely than that she was &quot;quite a beauty&quot;.

On the next day, the pack set out to unearth more information about the dead boy. Aleksandr spent his day asking around in the neighbourhood. Noone could - or wanted to - remember the girl. When he finally gave up and made his way home, he was stopped by a group of people from [[Neighbours for Neighbours]].  They told him he had been asking questions he shouldn't and blatantly threatened to blame him for a break-in should he not stop. It even seemed they would not exclude the use of force.

As they were still talking, a car headed up the street at twice the tempo limit. It made a dead stop in front of the opposite house, and four people jumped out, running into the house. After the initial shock, Aleksandr leaned back to see what Neighbours for Neighbours would do. The one who had spoken hesitated briefly and then went after the strange people. Everyone followed him, except one guy who stayed back and retreated inside a nearby house.

Grabbing the opportunity, Aleksandr decided to steal the car. He shortwired it and was just about to head down the street as something very big landed on the roof of the car. A furry arm reached inside, smashing the front window, and pulled the Irraka out into a deadly grip. Using the gift of his moon, Aleksandr was able to free himself with ease. The furious Urshul that had jumped atop the car was about to continue his attack as a familiar voice called: ''&quot;Boneblade! Leave it!&quot;''. [[Die Amazone]] had just left the building and was heading towards them. With considerable restraint, the young Rahu shifted back into Hishu, never taking his eyes of Aleksandr.

Die Amazone moved between them. ''&quot;Well, it seems we have an interesting way of meeting. This is our car, as you might have guessed. What exactly are you doing here, anyway?&quot;''. It became clear soon that the [[Crimson Tears]] had pursued a strange spirit into the building, which was now destroyed. They did not know anything about the girl. When they left, Aleksandr could not help but smile as they tried to fit into the heavily damaged car. It was just like Grigor, all these Rahus.

While Aleksandr's search showed no success, Grigori managed to locate the parents of the diseased lover with the help of Edouard. On his visit, they were initially also very tight-lipped, but loosened up a bit after some soothing words by Grigori. Finally, they told him that the girl was from the [[Eristoffs|Eristoff]] family, and that no-one enquired to closely about them and lived.

Her name, they said, was [[Alena Eristoff]].

==Act 2: A history lesson==

With a name at hand, the pack set about to find out more about the family. The results were discouraging: People either had not heard of them or were unwilling to talk about them. It took them several days to find out that they were running a tight, family-owned business in exports and imports and owned some warehouses at the harbour. None of the employees came from outside the family, and official records were totally lacking.

It seemed that there were 5 more important figures among the family: Isay, Ilpati, Iakov, Ioann and Irinei. They lived in five big buildings, two of which were in Crimson Tears territory. Again, only family members lived in the buildings, and the neighbours from other buildings were unwilling to talk about them. They only issued warnings: ''&quot;Anyone enquiring to closely will disappear.&quot;'' The homes were secured with quite modern devices. The pack soon found out that there were also much older devices not connected to the world of humans at all -- Spirits, protecting the Eristoffs from Hisil attacks. 

When Grigor and Aleksandr tried to enter the home, they were overcome with a sudden aversion, strong enough to prompt them to leave. Aleksandr returned later, avoiding the door and heading for a window to enter the ground floor. He found nothing of use there, and a metal gate with a digital lock barring the stairs up. Bypassing the lock took quite some effort, but he managed. As he was heading up the stairs, the ground suddenly gave way, sending him crashing into the cellar. Ignoring the pain in his left leg, he made his way back up, only to find the stairs completely intact. Not wanting to risk further encounters with the wards of this house, Aleksandr left.

Observing the houses with his two-world eyes, Angus found out their spirits had been awakened. He could also see other spirits lingering around the house. Even more surprising, it seemed that the family heads were accompanied by [[Handmaidens of Bloodshed]] in the Hisil. Someone paid a high price in essence for the protection of this family.

Grigori tried to contact the familiy heads for a meeting, but they did not return any calls. Other attempts to initiate correspondence were equally unsuccessful: The Eristoffs were blocking the pack away. Only one ominous statement could be elicited by Ioann: ''&quot;Please stop this, you are endangering yourself and us.&quot;''

The pack learned what that meant a few nights later.

They received a warning in the form of a howl resounding through much of St. Petersburg. It was die Amazone, and her message was clear and simple: Pure. The pack gathered in their Van and tried to identify where the attackers came from. Their bond with the [[EepEep]] was their biggest help: They were able to gain information about a big truck heading into the territory at high speed, accompanied by bikes. As soon as they learned where, they rushed off in pursuit.

As they had suspected, they found the truck parked in the front of one of the Eristoff houses. Dead people lay scattered across the street in front of the house, most of them wearing 'Neighbours for Neighbours' jackets. Three bikes were parked next to the van. As the pack watched from their van, they saw werewolves -- clearly in Dalu form -- pulling people out of the house and shoving them into the truck. Then, they closed the doors and went on. Their destination appeared to be the next family home.

Aleksandr accelerated the van, trying to force the truck to a stop. As he followed it around a bend, the bikes suddenly stopped and accelerated towards the van. Shortly before the vehicles collided, the riders jumped off, one landing on top of the van, the other two beside it. There was no time to think, as the next thing they saw were gargantuan claws ripping a large piece of the roof away from the van.

The pack dropped its automatic weapons and collectively shifted into gauru. This was no time for half-hearted efforts. They charged out of the van, Grigor jumping on top to face the biggest of the Pure.

Aleksandr was the first to jump out of the side, and he was greeted with a fierce slash that tore half of his face away. He winced, and before he could recover his opponent sank his teeth into his side, crippling his left arm. The Irraka let out one last howl and then dropped to the ground unconscious.

Grigori and Angus met a more fortunate fate. Their opponent tore into Grigori, who was able to stand his ground. Angus used the opening to land a vicious bite on the Pure, but their enemy just kept on fighting. Nonetheless, he was loosing ground to his opponents.

Edouard went out after Aleksandr, but he was able to avoid the fate of his packmate. He concentrated on defence, avoiding several blows of his enemy before taking a serious hit.

Meanwhile, Grigor and his enemy faced off on the top of the van. The Pure had assumed primal form, giving him a distinct advantage. Yet the Rahu was channelling the blessings of Mother Luna, evening the odds. Their fierce struggle resulted in both of them taking serious wounds, but without anyone gaining the upper hand, they fought on, determined to kill the other.

Grigori took a hit from his opponent, but as the Pure moved in to exploit the temporary weakness, Angus pounced him and tore his throat out. His victim dropped to the ground motionless, assuming Hishu form. 

Both moved quickly to help out Edouard, who was already bleeding from several wounds and about to join Aleksandr on the ground.

Just at that moment a car raced around the bend, the passengers instantly opening fire from several automatic weapons. Edouards enemy was thrown backwards and ran for the hills. Both werewolves on top of the van took several hits, and suddenly roared in panic and ran off in different direction, fox frenzy suppressing all their thoughts.

The car came to a halt, and Schatten der Zaren jumped out. ''&quot;Not a second to late, it seems. You held your ground very well.&quot;'' Angus was anything but pleased about the 'help'. ''&quot;Why did you not get here earlier? Is this what this so-called alliance is about? We almost lost two members!&quot;'' Just as he stood up to the old Elodoth, another howl split the night, resounding from further south. It told of victory, but also of loss. It was Boneblades voice. Everyone exchanged glances, fearing what this would mean.

Silently, the two packs loaded the body of the Pure Angus had slain into the car, and then Schatten der Zaren drove off without saying another word. The pack gathered what it could from the scene and set out in search for their Rahu.

They finally found him in a cellar he had broken into. It seemed that at least they had another clue: In the cellar were the bodies of two people, with bits missing everywhere. It was not the bitemarks of a Gauru, though. And when he recovered his senses, Grigor told them of a strange spirit he had destroyed when cornered, something looking light a giant wasp.

On the next day, the full extent of the nights raid became clear: Three of the five branches of the Eristoffs had been taken by the Pure. Victor Flammendes-Schwert send around a message that there would be a meeting in three days to discuss the situation.

Angus was stunned. Three days? He would be lucky if he had a pack left by then, if things went on like this...

==Act 3: A brewing menace==

The pack used the days before the meeting to lie low and gather their strength. They were running low on essence, and most of them had been seriously injured in the raid by the Pure. Police investigations around the incident ceased quite quickly. Officially, biker gangs had duelled and wiped each other out. Angus smiled at that sad excuse.

[[Alliance]] meets to respond to pure attacks and [[In memory of Amazone|mourn]] the [[Die Amazone|casualties]]. [[Shadowclaws]] claim the residential area as their territory.

Eristoffs under investigation by police. Learn more about family, make first contacts. Fight against [[Rahglu]], learn the hard way that they are quite dangerous. Find more dead bodies in closed-off buildings.

Ioann Eristoff arrested. [[Edouard]] helps him take all the guilt upon himself, so the rest of the family gets away clean.

Alena Eristoff shows up at [[Edouard]]'s place, badly beaten but alive. Tells some interesting details about the family, and that Ioann told her to seek shelter with Edouard.

Witness [[First Change]] of Ilya Eristoff, kill another attacking Pure. Find out that someone broke into Marinekathedrale. Behind a wall, old part. There seems to be a nest of the Rahglu down there, and a [[old altar|locus]]. Convince Ilpati that Ivory Claws are no longer in charge.

=Second Episode=

==Act 4: Know your enemy==

Rahglu escape again, send out three raiding parties, pack largely fails to counter them. They abduct around 20 people and nearly kill [[Nievo Ashkov]]. Pack starts thinking of ways to destroy them, visits exhibition on insects.

They find out a famous scientist has been sent a video by so-called [[Mythhunters]], showing Grigor and Edouard fight the Rahglu. He dismisses it as nonsense and willingly gives it to Grigori. The pack starts investigating the Mythhunters, catches one as he tries to enter the Marinekathedrale.

Further investigations lead to a tract of cellars that the Mythhunters have set their eyes upon. The pack gets there first and finds some Rahglu, confirming their suspicion that the Queen is not needed to lay eggs -- the simple drones can do that. They win the fight, though it is close.

They finally put together what they have and determine that they are about to loose the fight -- if all the abducted people successfully hatch more Rahglu, the numbers of them will grow beyond a point where the pack can defend. The queen seemed to be getting more and more intelligent, carrying out raids to abduct people, and they already had a number of ridden humans at their command.

They determined to do a surgical strike -- an attack on the hive to destroy its capabilities. Certain they could never face all the Rahglu, the things they first had to do were: Find a diversion, gain allies for the attack, and find out what they could do to cause the most damage.

They found a diversion in the spirit of the [[garbage-burning facility]], who was offered a steep price: Any archeological findings during the excavation of the new subway system would be stored in the facility (and effectively burned). In return, the facility spirit flooded the halls of the Rahglu with a strong odour, temporarily disabling their communication.

They determined three targets: Kill the Queen, change the attunement of the locus down there to deny the Rahglu their food, and kill the abducted humans to deny the eggs to hatch.

To kill the Queen, they took [[Sergei Grigorovich|Boneblade]] along, who was eager to be accepted into the Blood Seekers. He was accompanied by Grigor. Edourd led some Eristoffs to kill the humans. Angus gained the support of [[She-Who-Was-Eternally-Lost]] to change the locus, though she would claim the newfound one.

==Final: Raid on the hive==

Their raid was half successful: They changed the attunement of the locus and killed a good portion of the abducted humans, though Boneblade and Grigor could not get past the Queen's Guards. They had to retreat when the dense smog lifted, leaving behind two dead Eristoffs.

Time would have to show if the raid was sufficient to dislodge the parasitic wasp-spirits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1151">The 'Neighbours for Neighbours' are a neighbourhood watch scheme initiated via the [[Admiralteyski Wochenblatt]]. They form small groups, who keep watch in an area to the south of the packs territory. They [[Breeding Grounds|interfered]] with the pack on some occasions, but seem to be quite popular among the locals.

They are, or at least were, somehow involved with the [[Eristoffs]]. Some of them were slaughtered when the Pure attacked, but they recovered quickly, and seem to be better equipped recently. They are currently trying to be recognised as a charitable organisation, which they achieved [[Media:Zeitung9.pdf|by now]]. 

Recently, they gained support rather rapidly, and now there are even a growing number of policemen who hail the Neighbours for Neighbours as a helpful initiative to combat crime and corruption.

[[Nievo Ashkov]], Head of Admiralteyski West, seems to be opposed to the idea. Yet he was heavily wounded and is currently in hospital, with release not due for another month. In contrast, [[Eris Bobrov]], Head of Admiralteyski East, was always an outspoken supporter of them.

They seem to have protection within the [[St Petersburg City Administration|city administration]], as there is never any reaction to the frequent complaints by residents.

The club has three floors, and admittance is strictly monitored - without expensive designer-clothes, the only possibility to get in seems to be accompanying one of the regulars. With less than resources 3, one cannot afford to go here - and even then its more a 'once in a month' thing.

The club is infamous not only for the noise that disturbs the local population, but also for the tendency of people to disappear around its premises. This is attributed to young girls (and occasionally boys) seeking a better life as playmate and running off with one of the people visiting the club.

In fact, general opinion in the packs territory seems to be that they are a bunch of incompetent fools, wasting tax money - a view reflected by numerous articles in the [[Admiralteyski Wochenblatt]].

The Administration is huge, but there are some parts that are important for the pack:

* [[St Petersburg Sewage and Waste Authority]], the employer of Angus, who leads the branch for western Admiralteyski.
* [[St Petersburg Cultural Heritage Authority]], the employer of Grigori, who currently works as a restauration supervisor.
* [[Admiralteyski Police Department]], strictly speaking not a part of the city administration but of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MVD Ministry of Internal Affairs]. They work together closely and are often perceived as one entity. [[Nievo Ashkov]] is a senior officer within the appartment, responsible for the [[Shadowclaws|pack]]'s [[territory]].

[[Edouard]] knows some of the more important members from his work at [[Menatep Bank]], a bank that sometimes provides credits for construction projects.

It consists of a number of subdivisions:

* Western Admiralteyski police department: This is where [[Nievo Ashkov]] works, and it is responsible for the [[territory]] of the [[Shadowclaws|pack]]. It is housed in a building complex together with a fire department on a small island in the northwest of Admiralteyski.
* Eastern Admiralteyski police department: Recently got a new head, [[Eris Bobrov]]. He has a similar background to Nievo Ashkov and is already being hailed as his pupil and successor. There is a growing number of rumours that the two know each other well and worked a lot together. [[Angus]] knows first-hand from Nievo that he didn't even know Eris' name a week ago. The new head is very popular and a supporter of [[Neighbours for Neighbours]].

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militsiya#Militsiya_in_the_Russian_Federation Militsiya], as the police is called, is renowned for brutality and corruption, as well as lack of funds. Quoted from the english wiki:

The results of a poll conducted on November 10, 2005, published by Izvestia, show that 72% of people are afraid of militsiya because the militiamen are thought to often take illegal actions against innocent people. Another 2005 poll showed that 41% of the Russian population fears the militsiya more than organized crime.

In contrast to this the local head of police, Nievo Ashkov, is very popular and renowned for efficiency, honesty - and lack of funds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6418">Angus waved towards [[Nievo Ashkov|Nievo]], who was examining a crime
scene. The yellow &quot;do not cross&quot; lines barred Angus from moving
any further into the room. Nievo stepped out of the room,
grunting &quot;How come I am not surprised to see you here? You
always show up at the crime scenes of the ''interesting''
cases!&quot; Angus reflexively answered &quot;Crime scene? That guy wasn't
killed here...&quot;, and instantly chided himself silently. He had routinely
checked the room with his Death Sight and Two-World Eyes, to see
if this was another one of the Spirit killings. Luckily, this
time it didn't seem so. &quot;What?&quot; Nievo looked at him
suspiciously. &quot;How would you know? How ''could'' you even know?
''I'' don't know this, yet!&quot; Angus cursed silently again. He was
no [[Edouard]], who would have smoothly talked his way out of
this. In fact, Edouard wouldn't have let this slip in the first
place. &quot;Look... it's the... how the body is... ehm,
well. There's no blood on the floor, but some here in the hall.&quot;
He had seen, or better smelled, the faint blood drops here just
now, just in time.

Nievo looked around, and motioned his cops to secure the
complete hallway. &quot;Hrm. I'd really like to know how you're
always the one who shows up at the more interesting
crimes. Never at an ordinary mugging, or burglary. I'd really
like to ask, but I'm afraid of the answer I'd get...&quot; Angus
didn't answer to that. Better to keep quiet, he thought. And
Nievo hadn't asked directly, so he needn't give an answer. This
time, at least. &quot;But you're right more often than not&quot;, Nievo
sighed. &quot;...far more often than not.&quot; 

The two men left the building after Nievo made sure that the
rest of the work was done by his officers. &quot;So, what is it that
you want this time, Angus?&quot; Both entered a small coffee shop and
ordered a cup. &quot;I've been talking to the [[Eristoffs]]&quot;, Angus
replied. Nievo laughed. &quot;Of course you have! I should have
known... For years no-one has talked to the Eristoffs, no-one
even knew what they did. Then, right after the raid on their
houses, you're telling me that you're an old friend of the
family?&quot; -- &quot;Well, not an old friend. Not even a friend in that
sense of the word. But I've come to know [[Ilya Eristoff]],
and... well... I'm personally interested in his case, let's put
it this way.&quot; Nievo put down his cup of coffee. &quot;The
Eristoffs... they're frightened of something, I can tell. I just
don't know of what. And it's not only the recent attack on their
family. I wouldn't trust one of them as far as I could throw
them. A lot of shady business going on with that
family. Hrm... but that's politics, and I can't also care about
politics. Enough work to keep the streets clean, I have
now&quot;. Angus tried to sound as non-committed as possible. &quot;Hm, I
trust your instincts, as always, Nievo. Perhaps whatever the
Eristoffs are frightened of and the attacks are the same thing?
Or rather, whatever the Eristoffs are frightened of, that
attacked them. The first attack was in the south... I've read
there was some gang and organised crime violence there,
recently?&quot; 

Nievo leaned back in this seat and crossed his arms
thoughtfully. &quot;There was a lot of fighting down there... You
know, you're beginning to sound like a Russian civil servant!
`That's not my area of responsibility!' The whole city is our
responsibility, Angus!&quot; Angus shook his head, and said in a very
quiet voice that sounded like he was far away with his thoughts: &quot;No, it isn't. ''Luckily'', it
isn't. Enough work here already...&quot; Nievo decided not to press
further.  

--- 

&quot;All set up? Any problems?&quot; Angus asked [[Grigor]]. &quot;Nope, none
at all. Called a few favours, but generally speaking not much
resistance. The mafia wants to see order restored in the south
as much as we do.&quot; Yes, as much as we do, thought Angus. It's
just that it's not the same kind of order that we have
mind... And he shuddered to think of the
repercussions. Strengthening the mafia was never a good idea, he
thought. At least doing it this way, they could make sure that
Grigor was there to gain from the expansion. Better than
nothing. He'd have preferred to not involve the mafia in this,
but currently Angus saw no other way to &quot;solve&quot; the attacks on
the Eristoff homes. A rogue group of criminals operating from
the south had set out to kidnap as many Eristoffs as they
could. A weak cover, but all that they could come up with. They
needed the police off the Eristoffs backs.

Under Grigor's direction, the mafia had planted a number of clues
and false leads on a number of criminals in the south. He hoped
it would be enough to convince the police. If not, he'll have to
see if he could exert some political pressure on the police to
stop the case. He hoped that wouldn't be necessary. Better to
not get involved personally in this business. 

---

The cop arrived at Angus' home and rang the bell. &quot;Hiya Angus&quot;,
Nievo greeted and looked around. &quot;Seriously, why do you live
here, in this hell-hole? There must be other apartments you can
afford!&quot;  Angus invited the policeman into his flat. &quot;Well, yes
I could. But the rent is cheap, and I am relatively undisturbed
here. And someone needs to look after the poor chaps that live
around here...&quot; -- &quot;That's too noble a reason... no-one would
live here on purpose, Angus. Yet you seem to do...&quot;

They both went into the kitchen and sat at the table. Angus
reached for a bottle of whisky and two glasses. &quot;Anyway&quot;, Nievo
continued, &quot;it seems you were right again, with the
Eristoffs. Some kind of criminal gang in the south tried to
kidnap the entire family. I don't know why, and I probably will
never know why, with the bloody Eristoffs being as tight-lipped
as they are. So I've decided to investigate no further. I've got
more pressing needs currently, there's been another one of those
empty, eaten-out corpses...&quot; Augus took a mental note of
that. Another one of the [[Rahglu]] corpses, that was interesting. &quot;And the Eristoffs seem to feel safe in their new
homes. At least they're more out-going, now, after the
attack. Funny that...&quot; 

Angus shrugged. He poured the whisky into the glasses and passed
one to Nievo. &quot;To good health, and rapid case-solving!&quot; The
glasses chinked. &quot;I think I need a [[Angus quest for Harmony|holiday]], Nievo. Might be out of town for a few days.&quot;
Nievo looked thoughtfully into his glass. &quot;Holiday, hm? If only
I had the time...&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5896">Angus sighed. [[Breeding Grounds|Recently]], he had somehow lost
connection to their pack totem. Yes, Wissendes-Auge-der-Nacht still
came when he called, and still talked to him. But Angus had sensed
what was wrong from the beginning. The cat never mentioned anything,
but Angus had lost some of his spiritual balance. It was as if he
didn't care for the pack totem any more, Angus caught himself thinking
sometimes. 

He didn't know what to do. There was no-one he could ask. He could let
his pack members know what troubled him. They trusted him to keep the
pack totem link alive. No, they ''needed'' him to do just that. Angus
didn't dare to think what would happen if he admitted that he had
problems &quot;getting&quot; spirits. 

He could turn to any tribal elders and admit his weakness. Usually, he
would have started a conversation with Wissendes-Auge, but that now
was also impossible. No, he needed to do this on his own. 

Angus wasn't fond of human &quot;pulp-meditation&quot;, as he called it. Most
books and teachings on meditation were so far off, he couldn't take
them seriously. All these feel-good meditations. The point of
meditations was to clear your mind for the tasks ahead and to keep
perspective. But one of the book covers he had seen recently, of a man
meditating under a presumably ice-cold waterfall had roused his
interest. He decided he needed to go the place where he had first felt
his spiritual energies, the place where is wolf-side was born. Back to
the icy caverns of the Baltic, to hopefully find what he was missing
there. 

A few days later, all was set up. He had chartered a small boat, told
his pack mates that he would be gone for the day, perhaps two. He left
St Petersburg trying to find the exact location of the ice cavern once
again. His memories were hazy und unclear, but Alexandr had dug up a
lot of the police and journalistic evidence of that time. The &quot;diving
school of carnage&quot; they had called it. Angus was confident that he
could find the spot, given enough time. 

Contrary to the first time, he didn't use his diving
equipment. Checking to see if any other ships were around, Angus
changed into Urshul form, took a deep breath and jumped into the
ocean. He found the entrance to the flooded grotto without too many
difficulties. Inside, he dived up and went ashore. The cavern was
still in the same shape as he had remembered it. Angus followed the
icy walls to find the frozen fish, the locus. There he had first found
out that he could talk to spirits. There -- even the small pick that
one of the other divers had used to try to carve the fish out of the
ice was still lying on the ground. Angus let his hand flow over the
ice and touched the fish. He felt the by now familiar tingling of his
neck hairs -- it still was a locus. He wouldn't cross just now. He
merely sat down, in meditative pose and let his mind go. 

Deep in his meditation, Angus seemed to hear a whisper, from behind
him. A cold wind sent shivers down his spine. &quot;Why did you return,
half-blood? Not many come back to their first scene of crime...&quot; -- &quot;I
am here to find what I am missing,&quot; replied Angus. &quot;And what ''are''
you missing?&quot; the voice asked. &quot;That, I do not know. That is why I am
here, and not with my pack, doing my duties. I ''need'' to know,
otherwise I fear I cannot fulfill the duties placed upon us.&quot;

&quot;Why are you in the pack?&quot;

&quot;I am the Alpha.&quot;

&quot;Why are you the Alpha?&quot;

&quot;No-one will make the decisions, if not for me.&quot;

&quot;That is not a reason... The Alpha should give the pack more than the
other members can, otherwise they wouldn't accept you as the
Alpha. You are not the best warrior -- Grigor is. You are not the best
covert man -- Alexandr is. You cannot offer insights into the mortal
ways, Edouard knows far more and is more persuasive than you. Not even
in the Spirit world do you know more than your packmember Grigori. He
has never forgotten a single tale in his entire life!&quot;

&quot;I am the ritemaster. This is what I can offer.&quot; 

&quot;That is not exclusive! Even Grigor has started to learn Rites, and
Grigori would make a fine ritemaster, if he took it up. Being
ritemaster is not what you offer to the pack.&quot; 

&quot;Grigori would be a respectable ritemaster, if he weren't so
phlegmatic. He's content to let others do work that is needed. I
can't. Some things need to be done, even if they are unpleasent. The
pack is greater than the sum of its parts, but without a stern Alpha
hand, there is no pack. Only disorganised wolves pretending that a
pack totem is all you need.&quot; 

&quot;Yes, Storm Lord, you ''do''. You make decisions, you act, you
plan. Some of these decisions are bad, some acts go awry, and some
plans fail. Still, you do. Now, you are feeling lost. But as long as
you are searching for something, you know that you are missing
something. The real problem only arises if you stop searching. That's
when you stop to care and lose your ties to the spiritual world.&quot;

Angus awoke, lying on the icy ground. His body was partly frozen into
the ice, he groaned as he broke himself out of the icy prison. He
wasn't sure with whom, or with what, he had talked. He shifted back
into Urshul form, before the frozen limbs took even more damage. His
body started to channel his healing and his thick fur kept him rather
warm, even though he stood in an ice cavern. 

&quot;I thank you for letting me stay in your domain, ice-spirit&quot; Angus
growled in the First Tongue to the locus. &quot;Please accept this as a
token of my appreciation.&quot; He lumped bits of crushed ice together, bit
into his own leg and let the blood, and essence, drip into the ice. He
moved the blood-ice next to the locus focus point and bowed slightly. 

He waited for his body to heal the self-inflicted wound and then
jumped back into the ice-cold water, returning to his boat. It was
time to reap the reward of his work: the hate of those you guard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="847">The Night Cafe Petersburg is a club and bar in the northeast of the packs territory. It is reserved for rich people, and two doormen keep anyone out who does not fit with the clientele. The bar is infamous since it is located in a residential area - primarily for workers and employees - but does not stick to regulations about noise at night. In fact, it seems it enjoys special protections, as there has not been a police raid in years, despite neighbours complaining about the noise and somewhat frequent disappearances of people.

The disappearances are usually explained by young, beautiful people from the lower stratum of society running away to live as playmates or something similar. It is well-known that many of the male visitors of the club &quot;pick up&quot; such beauties to accompany them inside.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="590">A powerful yet fractured spirit court. It is related to negative emotions, but not to violent ones - gloom, despair and fear seem to be most prevalent. It is likely the most powerful court in the pack's territory, but it has almost no unity - there are some more powerful spirits in this court who are in fierce competition for followers. Prominent members include [[She-Who-Was-Eternally-Lost]] and [[Pitch Black]].

Another powerful member was the previous owner of the pack's [[old radio|locus]], but it was destroyed by the pack.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="824">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_Square Palace Square] is a square in central St. Petersburg, located in the no-man's-land between the [[Shadowclaws]] and the [[Glasfelle]]. It is the historical center of the civil city (opposite the military and political centre, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Paul_Fortress Peter and Paul Fortress]) and site of several events of world-wide importance. Unsurprisingly, there is also a very lively hisil here.

The pack did not yet venture to explore the spirit side of square. They know, though, that there is a monthly [[The High Court of Petersburg|court]] here, residing on nights of the full moon. They used it [[The fate of The Bleeding Stone|once]] to get to a [[The Bleeding Stone|spirit]] which they could not hunt down.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="791">It seems there is a court of spirits of Jaggling Rank, meeting at the [[Palace Square]] on nights where the moon is split. This court can issue decisions on its members, known as a trial by peers. The spirits seem to adhere by this decisions.

Werewolves - those that are of Jaggling rank - avoid the court. This is due to the fact that any participator is deemed a member, and therefore also subject to rulings of the court. No sane Forsaken wants to submit himself to the rulings of a bunch of Jagglings.

The [[Shadowclaws|pack]] [[The fate of The Bleeding Stone|once]] persuaded a number of members of the court to jugde a [[The Bleeding Stone|spirit]] for them. None of them has been to the court, and none has the rank required.

      <comment>*shakes head at Edouard*</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1891">&quot;This pen is really nice,&quot; [[Edouard]] thought while listening to the endless droning at the board meeting. His notepad is now full of more or less geometric lines and circles. The topic at hand is the upcoming summer marketing campaign where the bank's customers are invited for a drink, cheap sandwiches and most importantly colourful flyers.

&quot;What about the children?&quot; [[Edouard]] interrupted the speaker. &quot;We want the parents to be at ease and spend as much time as possible with us.  I suggest we use a separate room to let the children have their fun without distracting their parents from doing business with us. I will take care of it and mail you the estimate of costs until the day after tomorrow.&quot;

After the meeting, [[Edouard]] had a talk with his secretary about the upcoming festivities. They came to the conclusion that they hire one or two babysitters who supervise the children, organise crayons and paper. In addition to that, Edouard wanted to have a coloring book created that tells a nice &quot;fairy tale&quot;.

In that &quot;fairy tale&quot;, there was a beautiful young woman, and every man in the country wanted to spend time with her. But they got jealous and spent most of their time fighting each other about the woman. In the end they decided to kill her (his secretary assured her that children in Russia are used to hearing storys about executions as long as they are vague on the details).

The woman was so beautiful, that even the stones loved her and the stone where the woman's head rested waiting for decapitation sacrificed itself to save the woman's life.

During the following confusion, the woman was able to flee the city.

As an extra task for the children, Edouard wanted the children to draw a picture of the [[The fate of The Bleeding Stone|bleeding stone]] with a competition where they could win cheap but shiny prices.

Here is a table of the known courts and some very general (and, again, probably wrong) properties. Spirits are fielded under their court, if known. Unaligned Spirits or those whose allegiance is unknown are in a list below the table.

Further down on this page is information on the politics between the courts, which is mostly speculation by the werewolves.

|-
|[[Concrete Wood]] || relatively low || everywhere || buildings, streets, channels ... || almost exclusivelty gafflings, jagglings often leave the court and join one associated with their specific building
|-
|[[Court of Eternal Grace]] || unknown, at least locally high || concentrated on separate locations || Performing Arts, legends and stories ... || [[Prince Yaromir]], [[the maiden]], probably [[Meister im Norden]], [[The Bleeding Stone]], [[Kaffeehaus]]. True extent of the court is unknown.

'''Spirits with unknow affiliation'''
* [[Athumu]] - probably destroyed by the Great Slimy One.
* [[Cinema Spirit]] - has helped the pack twice, but seems to be largely solitary. Probably heads a small court. Probably not.
* [[Daemonium]] - a very powerful spirit representing negativ aspects of the cities history and present. Only [[Angus]] has heard about it.
* [[Window-to-the-West]] - another very powerful spirit of St. Petersburg. Patron of the [[Enlightened]] lodge. Largely unknown.
* [[The Son and the Nephew]] - a court? two courts? two weird spirits ... what will become of them now?

'''Politics'''

* Internal Strife in Grey Court.
* Court of Eternal Grace on good terms with Urban Ronins.
* [[The High Court of Petersburg]] - who is a member, how far reaches its power?
* Network/Information/Order: possibly alied.
* Handmaidens of Bloodshed: For hire to highest bidder.

==A True Leader?==

Juha hurried into the new youth centre in the south of Admiralitetsky, shaking the last of the freezing rain out of his hood. He was a young Finnish lad, 17 years old or so, and judging from his meagre clothing, he came from a poor immigrant family, like most in the neighbourhood. Nodding his head in greeting at one of his younger compatriots, he cast his eye around the large common room, freshly decorated with posters and pot plants: it was home to several comfy chairs and coffee tables, vending machines and a bar, a notice board, a pool table, and a jukebox. Rumours abounded concerning the identity of the mysterious benefactor who had suddenly decided to fund the place's establishment... It had proven to be a hit, although the shabby-looking clientele didn't nearly match the quality of its outfittings. Still, that was being rectified soon enough: already some tribal grafitti adorned its outside walls, and another boy picked away at the fabric of one of the new chairs.

Grigor poked his face in from the private meeting room in the cellar and tilted his head, indicating that Juha should come down. After, Grigor locked the door behind him. The place already stank from one of the boss' horrid brand of cigarettes, but obviously everyone knew better than to complain. The youth sat down quietly beside the three others, another Finn and two hard-looking Ukrainian lads who were sharing some private joke. The unshaven Grigor sat down on the only table in the room and rapped his knuckles on it to bring the group to attention. ''&quot;Right boys, no games this evening! We've got a job to do.&quot;'' Juha found it difficult to look him in the eye -- the man had an intense feral look about him, as if he
was always only one heartbeat away from deadly violence. Which, if rumour was to be believed, was not so very far from the truth...

''&quot;Before we begin, just something to take care of...&quot;'' Grigor opened a black leather bag that looked like some kind of toolbox, withdrawing a syringe and a fistful of small glass vials. ''&quot;I need a sample from each of you.&quot;'' he growled, gesturing for them to raise up their sleeves. ''&quot;What's that for, boss?&quot;'' asked Marko, the biggest of the Ukrainians, lazily chewing gum. ''&quot;Don't ask questions.&quot;'' Grigor abruptly retorted. Marko rolled up his T-shirt, revealing a tattooed and muscled arm -- obviously a wannabee boxer. The boss began taking a blood sample from each. ''&quot;Don't worry,&quot;'' he laughed, ''&quot;the needle's clean. Needs to be real clean... It's only the gays who get the aids, anyway, and I'll not have any bummers working for me... least none of you lot better be.&quot;''

From each of the freshly-collected vials of blood, Grigor emptied a small amount into a portable brazier which he retrieved from the case. Before safely stowing the vials away, he firstly dipped his little finger delicately into each, in turn. He tasted each sample in turn, pausing momentarily in concentration. He then took a knife to his own palm, cutting out a few drops of his blood into the mix.

Juha was, not for the first nor the last time, beginning to question the wisdom of working for this man. He seemed to have some very odd beliefs, and sanity didn't exactly seem to be his strong point. He was now burning away the splashes of blood in the brazier -- stinking up the room even more -- and inhaling deeply of the fumes. He began some kind of prayer or incantation. Juha didn't understand most of it -- some gobbledegook about a &quot;Father Wolf&quot; watching over them and blessing their &quot;hunt&quot;... What the fuck?

The young men glanced surreptitiously and uncertainly at each other, carefully masking their scepticism and disgust, in case Grigor glanced in their direction. The mafia man finished the weird ceremony and cleaned up the accoutrements scrupulously, packing them away in his work case. He brushed his hands together and cleared his throat. ''&quot;Right now, the job. Pay attention -- if you don't, you'll end up dead, sooner than you think. Some independent immigrant asshole down here is peddling some drugs, and the bosses don't like it. People stepping on their noses, taking their money and customers and shit. So we're going to put him out of business... permanently.&quot;''

''&quot;Now, if it comes down to a fight, you need to remember three things...&quot;'' Grigor proceeded to give a short motivational speech... Curiously, his words began to make sense to Juha, and the young Finn felt his fears melting away, to be replaced by confidence and anticipation. He felt up for a fight and bunched his fists together... ''&quot;So, are you ready?!&quot;'' Grigor cried. The boys leaped from their seats and punched at the air. Grigor smiled in satisfaction at the
effect the words had had on his new followers.

==So Much for the Backup==

According to Grigor's plan, three of the boys had gone on ahead to the target's kiosk, from where he was supposedly peddling the drugs, while he and Juha had a different objective. Juha wondered if this meant that the boxer had identified him as the one in the group most suited to... subtler tasks?

It was late evening, and the two of them made their way unobtrusively through the dark, dishevelled streets, Grigor still clutching his sturdy black leather work case. As they were about to cross the main road, a large articulated lorry, presumably heading for the steel works, rumbled towards them. ''&quot;Stop!&quot;'' Grigor hissed suddenly to Juha, ''&quot;the truck!&quot;'' Without any further ado, the boss sprinted off the side of the road and into a nearby yard, hiding away from the vehicle behind some garbage bins. Juha scrambled after him, confused, and crouched down beside him. ''&quot;What is it, boss?&quot;'' he whispered. ''&quot;It's the Pure!&quot;'' Grigor replied frantically, ''&quot;They're coming to take us away! Like the others!&quot;'' Juha had no idea what this meant, but for the first time he saw real fear in the Russian's face, and so he decided not to ask any further questions. ''&quot;Uh... okay&quot;'' he murmured, ''&quot;well I don't think they saw us.&quot;'' The lorry motored past noisily and made its way off towards the steel works. Several moments passed, with Grigor breathing heavily, staring off into space... Unsettled, Juha eventually ventured a look out from behind the bins. ''&quot;Well, I think they're gone now. You can come out.&quot;'' They hurried on to their destination, and Juha decided it would be best to say no more about this strange episode.

A short way up the road was a large bar, frequented mostly by Ukrainians. Grigor seemed to have recovered his composure. ''&quot;Right, this is the place,&quot;'' he said, as he lead the boy inside.

As Grigor and his protege sipped at their vodkas in a corner, the Rahu briefly explained the plan to Juha. ''&quot;Right, we have to figure out who this guy is.&quot;'' He then fished out his mobile phone and called up Marko. ''&quot;Yeah, it's a go. Give him a bit of grief, but DON'T overdo it! Just enough for him to make the call.&quot;'' The two then sat back and unobtrusively watched the clientiele. After a minute or two, Juha nudged Grigor and pointed out a burly guy at the bar. He was answering his phone with a frown. After the call, the figure seemed to curse under his breath, before quickly grabbing his leather jacket and making his way to the door. ''&quot;Yeah, that's our man,&quot;'' Grigor affirmed, and the two quickly drank up and followed him out.

The target had hurried to his motorbike, parked in a dark cul-de-sac next to the bar. Grigor quickly eyed up the situation -- favourable, since no-one else was around -- and smiled grimly to himself. He handed the leather case to the young Finn. ''&quot;Here, hold this and keep an eye out for any trouble from the corner.&quot;'' Juha did as he was told and went to watch the main street. From behind him in the alley, he heard some kind of warning growl. Strange... the target must have had a dog with him? A few moments later, there was the sound of a brief commotion or fisticuffs, culminating in a terminal-sounding groan, and the crash of a slowly-toppling bike. Juha didn't turn around -- some things are better not to know, he thought to himself. A few seconds later, his strange boss emerged, dusting off his hands, and clapped the lad on the shoulder. He didn't seem much out of breath. ''&quot;So much for the backup,&quot;'' he growled.

==Out of Business==

It was late evening in the immigrant district. The makeshift shop -- little more than a shack -- had some unwelcome visitors... Inside, the proprietor, an elderly man dressed in a traditional smock, was frightened and cornered, blood running from his freshly-broken nose, desperately fending off three youths with a baseball bat. It looked like they had started to trash the place. Marko, the Ukrainian, seemed to be enjoying the job, and he leered at the owner. ''&quot;Yeah, what are you going to do about it, old man, Mr Drug Dealer? Call the police?&quot;'' The lads laughed. As if seizing on the idea, the old guy desperately fumbled for the phone on the wall. There was no tone. Swearing desperately in Ukranian, he instead yanked out his mobile phone. One of the lads stepped forward as if to stop him, but Marko held him back. ''&quot;Yeah old man,&quot;'' he grinned, ''&quot;call your friend again, why don't you? Tell him to hurry! We're all waiting here...&quot;'' They laughed again.

There was the sound of a ringing phone from just outside, and then the back door smashed open. Grigor, followed by Juha, fresh from cutting the phone line, strolled in menacingly. Grigor waved the still-ringing mobile phone in the air, wiping the blood off it. ''&quot;You called?&quot;'' The blood seemed to drain from the old man's face. ''&quot;Where's Sergei?!&quot;'' he gasped. ''&quot;Sergei's not coming,&quot;'' the Rahu responded ominously.

The boys backed off, letting Grigor step in. The owner swung desperately at the Blood Talon, but Grigor caught his arm deftly with a smirk, snapping it behind his back. With his other arm, he grabbed the old man's jaw, and shook it roughly. ''&quot;Where's the drugs, you old fucker?&quot;'' The helpless owner seemed to hesitate for a moment... Grigor glanced over to Juha. ''&quot;Start by breaking one of his fingers...&quot;'' The young Finn looked uncertain, but Marko stepped forward with a grin, picking up the dropped baseball bat. Grigor forced one of the man's hands onto the counter, splaying out his fingers. Marko eyed up the blow... ''&quot;Alright, alright,&quot;'' the old man spluttered, ''&quot;I'll show you. I'll fuckin' show you! Motherfuckers.&quot;'' Grigor freed him up enough so that he could rummage out a plastic carton hidden underneath the counter. The Rahu snatched it out of his hands and briefly inspected its contents. Bingo. ''&quot;Thankyou. Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?&quot;'' He didn't allow any time for the old man to reply, however, and smashed his fist into his gut. The wretched victim crashed to the floor, coughing and doubling up.

Grigor withdrew his heavy pistol from his back pocket and handed it to Marko. ''&quot;You're up,&quot;'' he ordered, nodding in the direction of the helpless owner, who recovered sufficiently to begin begging for mercy in between bloody coughs and gasps of air. The big Ukrainian lad seemed to hesitate. Grigor leaned in to his face. ''&quot;C'mon, we have to set an example to these fucks! Do you want to be a man, or don't you?&quot;'' Juha watched in horrified fascination as the Blood Talon leant in closer to Marko's ear, whispering seductively. He didn't catch what was said, but evidently the boss had said the right words, because the Ukrainian's gaze adopted a fanatical look and slowly roved over the old guy on the floor. He raised the gun... BAM. It was done.

Bear's Bane promptly took his leather case from Juha and selected a syringe from inside, carefully taking a blood sample from the dead guy. Meanwhile, the lads looked on nervously, in a hurry to leave as soon as possible after the gunshot. Grigor didn't seem too rushed, however. After finishing with his sample, he strode over to the till, and relieved it of its cash. He doled out the notes to each of the four lads, who certainly weren't slow to accept them, giving a few extra to Marko. ''&quot;Right, let's get out of this shithole.&quot;'' He spotted a cardboard box full of a decent vodka, placed the drugs inside it, and tucked it under his arm. Before leaving, he knocked the rest of the alcohol over and flicked a lit match on the wreckage. Half of the floor quickly leapt up in flames.

A few yards away from the shack, now starting to burn well, was a rubbish dumpster. Grigor opened up his case again, extracting a clear plastic bag containing a similar-looking gun to his. He carefully emptied the bag into the dumpster without touching its contents. ''&quot;Even the pigs shouldn't be dumb enough to miss this,&quot;'' he muttered to himself. The gun had been given to him by Angus, along with a suggestion. [[To serve and protect|Something]] about framing someone &quot;guilty&quot; and needing to &quot;boost the police clean-up rates&quot;. Whatever.</text>

      <comment>/* Fighting Style: Wolf Form */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7405">====What is this about?====

Right now, in my experience, Combat in WoD quickly boils down to: everyone roll damage, regenerate, start over. Few dramatic things happen, indeed sometimes combat just drags out until one side has rolled enough successes. I like the nWoD system a lot, but after seeing DnD4, which at its core is more a tactical combat simulation than an RPG, and Savage Worlds, where one can effectively (and even does rather often) substitute a cool action for a simple attack roll, combat seems a bit disappointing. After Christoph said he had the same feeling, I came up with a few ideas to remedy that fact and put tactis back into combat. Werewolves fight a lot, they are supposed to fight as a pack, and that should involve more than just enjoying the penalty to defense an opponent gets for multiple attackers (more on that later).

It is easy to come up with some examples where the result of a roll might be influenced by additional actions:

* A Rahu fighting another Werewolf could try to slam his opponent into a nearby closet.
* A fleeing Irraka could try to topple trash cans and similar things to hinder his pursuer.
* An Ithaeur could use a gift to create a distraction to shooting enemies so he and his pack can cross the killing ground easier.
* While fighting a number of spirits, the Elodoth tries to lure one opponent into the midst of the pack by slowly moving backwards, hoping the spirit realises to late that its flanks are no longer covered.
* When a fight erupts on the side of a big street, the Cahalith tries to use the weight of his Urshul form to push an attacker into traffic.

Below are new rules (largely) tested by Christoph and Jan. They will likely be implemented at the next meeting, but are still open for discussion and suggestions until then.

====Stunts in Combat====

It is possible to try performing a stunt instead of your normal attack roll. This usually means you roll Attribute+Skill, minus a fitting Resistance if an opponent is targeted:

* The Rahu rolls his Strength+Brawl-Defense as usual, but on a success he does not deal normal damage, instead slamming his opponent into the closet (where he will likely take further damage and be hindered next turn as determined by the GM).
* The Irraka rolls Wits+Composure, minus the opponents Resolve. Successes achieved penalize his opponents roll this turn.
* The Ithaheur rolls his Gift and counts as resistance the highest in the group+1. If he succeeds, all enemies take a penalty to shooting attack rolls until the Gift ends.
* The Elodoth rolls Presence+(Intimidate or Subterfuge) - Resistance. If he succeeds, he can pull the spirits into the ranks of the pack.
* The Cahalith rolls Strength+Size-opponent's Size (he is not trying for anything subtle, simply the application of mass and power). If he succeeds, he pushes the opponent into traffic. The opponent can then consult the &quot;being hit by a car&quot;-chart to determine his fate (and probably make a roll on Dex+Athletics to dodge cars, penalised depending on traffic).

====Sensible usage of maps====

A map with figures/tokens/whatever representing characters and enemies will be used for larger, central battles, if it is appropriate - for example, for the assault on the Rahglu hive, for the attack on the Great Slimy One, but not for the wild chase that was the final scene in the battle for the Bleeding Stone.

For smaller skirmishes, we won't bother, so it is unlikely the map will be used more than once or twice an adventure.

====Fighting Style: Wolf Form====

There is now a Fighting Style: Wolf Form, which can be used in both Urshul and Urhan. The Fighting Style offers a choice for each dot of the merit bought - you can choose freely at each dot. You can also buy the other alternative by spending 2xlevel XP.

Note that all manoeuvres listed are mutually exclusive - you can not Exploit Advantage Grappling Bite Hamstring Overpower your Opponent while using your Intuitive Reflexes to avoid damage.

* * Lurk: You have learned to circle your enemy, looking for an opening while concentrating on defence. When you use Full Defence, your opponent still takes the -1 Defence hit for being attacked.
* * Grappling Bite: You can use your jaws to grapple an enemy, forgoing precision for the chance to inflict pain. You can take a -3 penalty to your grapple attack. If you do so, the successes you achieve cause both lethal damage and count as grapple successes.

* ** Hamstring: You have learned to hit where it hurts, inflicting hindering injuries on your opponent. You can take a -3 penalty to your attack roll. If the attack scores at least 1 success, it additionally inflicts a -1 Penalty to Defence that stays until the wound heals. This might not work on a number of spirits, like Houses.
* ** Exploit Advantage: You have learned to use an opening in the opponent's defence with terrifying swiftness and accuracy. If the opponent is already at least at a -1 to Defence due to multiple attackers or any other weakness (e.g. Hamstring), his Defence is at an additional -1 for this attack.

* *** Jugular: Sacrificing defence, you leap at your opponent's throat. You take a -2 hit to Defence to gain &quot;9 again&quot; on your attack roll.
* *** Overpower: Flinging yourself at the opponent, you use raw power to overwhelm him and lock him in your jaws. If you grapple an opponent, you can take a -3 penalty to your grapple roll. If you still succeed, you can immediately follow up with an &quot;Overpower&quot; manoeuvre (see WoD Rulebook, pp. 157-159).

* **** Claw&amp;Bite: Who cares about defence if your opponent is dead? You launch forward, making both a Claw and a Bite attack against the same opponent. Your defence is 0 until your next turn. Successes on the two attack rolls are added for purposes of Kuruth checks.
* **** Intuitive Reflexes: You let your instincts take over, dodging enemy blows while closing in for the kill. You can use the higher of your Dex or Wits for Defence. In addition, you only start taking penalties for multiple attackers after the second attack, not after the first as usual. You can still attack normally (but not use another manoeuvre).

====Pack Tactics====

There is now a new merit:

Pack Tactics (* to ***):

You instinctively know what help your friend needs, communicating by mere scent and snarls and working in rarely witnessed harmony. When Werewolves familiar with each other (usually only packs and certain close-knit lodges) help another, add the highest applicable Pack Tactics trait of those involved to the roll. The usual restrictions still apply.

To clarify, two examples:

Grigor (Pack Tactics 2) and Angus (Pack Tactis 1) are helping Edouard (no Pack tactics) with his Persuasion by standing around looking like they might snap any moment. Grigor and Angus both add dice to Edourds roll equal to 1/3 their Presence+Intimidate (rounded real). Edourd than gains another 2 dice for Grigor's Pack Tactics 2 (highest applicable).

Grigori (Pack Tactics 1) helps Angus (Pack Tactics 2) dig up some information. Angus gains a number of bonus dice on his Int+Academics roll equal to 1/3 of Grigoris Int+Academics total, plus another 2 for his Pack Tactics 2 (highest applicable). Even if Grigor (Pack Tactics 3) is around in the library, his lacking knowledge (no Academics) means he is unable to help and therefore his Pack Tactics do not count.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3630">This is an overview of all important Characters in the Saga. Note that only inhabitants of the physical world are listed here. For the strange inhabitants of the Hisil, see [[Spirits]].

==Werewolves==

There is an [[alliance]] of Forsaken in the city, trying to keep internal quarrel to a minimum. It's a very loose society, mostly held together by the constant threat of the Pure besieging the City from the east.

===[[Shadowclaws]]===

The player's pack.

* [[Aleksandr]]
* [[Angus]]
* [[Edouard]]
* [[Grigor]]
* [[Grigori]]

* [[Dima Kochegarov]]
* [[Nastya Aleksandrovna]]
* [[Vanya Sokolow]]
* [[Yelena Dimitrovna]]

===[[Glasfelle]]===

===[[Crimson Tears]]===

Neighbours of the players', the two packs have often clashed. The pack changed a lot [[Battle against Rote Wut|recently]].

* [[Arja Haajanen]]
* [[Ilya Eristoff]]

===Unbound===

A very rare thing for werewolves, there are still some who do not bind themselves by pack and territory, instead choosing to wander, spending their lives travelling. Most of these meet a quick end at the claws of a more territorially inclined pack, but there are some who have the wits, resources or usefulness to survive.

* [[Smauri &quot;Forgesoul&quot; Ivarrson]], although it seems he has finally settled down now
* [[Yorek &quot;Howl-from-beyond&quot;]], grandfather of Nadja, relieved from a terrible burden by the pack
* [[Sergei Grigorovich|Boneblade]], former member of Crimson Tears, left after a public disupte with Arja; currently it is not known where he is
* Klauenwind, a former Rahu of [[Rote Wut]], lost in the Hisil ...

===Other===

Werewolves from other packs that live far away from Petersburg not to be important as a whole.

* [[André Fazegas]], a werewolf from Spain from the lodge of [[Lightning]]

===Pure===

There are few Pure that the players know by name - most of the fighting with the Pure occurs to the east of their territory, and usually they only meet them in battle.

* [[Whitefang]]

==Friends and Family==

Despite their savage nature, the pack has some friends among the human population.

===[[Eristoffs]]===

A family of Wolfblooded living in the pack's territory. Formerly used by the Ivory Claws for breeding Pure.

* [[Alena Eristoff]], girlfriend of Edouard

===Friends===

A rare thing for a werewolf, some of the pack count humans as true friends -- or more.

* [[Nadja Ivanetsch]], Angus' girlfriend
* [[Lana Yakisovna]], owner of [[Café Alexanderplatz]] who harbours a crush on Grigor

===Work Associates===

* [[Boris Koshonin]], trainee of Grigor
* [[Vladimir Wecek]], mafia boss of Grigor
* [[Nievo Ashkov]], head of [[Admiralteyski Police Department]] West and friend of Angus

==Other==

Other characters the players have come into contact with. 

* [[Dorofey Evgenikov]], patriarch of Petersburg
* [[Eris Bobrov]], head of Admiralteyski Police Department East
* [[Josuv Stanov]], strange kid
* [[Miika Kovalov]], business magnate involved with [[Neighbours for Neighbours]] and owner of [[Admiralteyski Wochenblatt]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2360">The sewers below the pack's territory have seen their share of action since the pack moved in. They were scene of a [[fight in the sewers|battle]] the pack fought against a rising spirit, during which they learned much about them.

While the physical side of the sewers is mostly inaccessible (like most sewers), the Hisil of the sewers is influenced by the common misconception people have about sewers, and allows for easy access, though they are still rather narrow. There is a rather strong [[sewer locus|locus]] here, site of constant battles among the spirits that inhabit the Hisil of the sewers. Since the fall of the [[Great Slimy One]] and [[Athumu]], the power vacuum has lead to constant fighting between several courts. Since this means the spirits are busy with each other and don't bother the physical world, the pack has done little to change this situation, though it makes the sewers dangerous ground to tread in.

Yet it seems there is more here. In the northern part of the territory's sewers, one can reach another, older part of the sewer Hisil. Here the sewers are wide enough to allow small boats to pass, or three people to stand next to each other on their sides. A small breeze can be felt, the air reeks of salt and fish rather than the usual stench, and it carries the old melody as from a distant lute. If one takes the right steps (following an [[the smuggler's song|old song]] that has been recently covered by Moskau Hotel), one finally reaches another [[smuggler's treasure|locus]] belonging to an enigmatic spirit the pack calls [[Meister im Norden]], since he seems to command the cat spirits in the sewers. The spirit seems little involved in the usual madness of the Hisil, preferring its solitary retreat.

There is also a part of the sewer Hisil where the air is filled with a red mist and screams of agony and pleasure. A sickening smell of blood, fear and sweat permeates the mist, and entering it leads one to a pit, where a narrow staircase leads to the origin of the violent sounds. Yet there are always a number of violent spirits here, attacking on sight, so little is known about this pit except that it seems to be the home of a court known as [[Roter Hof]] - an utterly unpleasent court that has caused trouble in the past.

And who knows what else the Hisil hides?

wo die Beute sich nicht lohnt

eilen direkt an den Staren

wo der fette Händler wohnt.

Den gilts heut Nacht auszunehmen

wagt er sich aufs Meer hinaus

findet er nicht sichren Hafen,

nein - die Klippen sind sein Aus!

Und wir nehmen seine Ware,

seine B¨orse und sein Weib.

Er wird nicht drum sorgen müssen

mit dem Schwert in seinem Leib.

Dann gehts wieder in die Stadt rein

doch oben ist es uns zu heiß

durch die Gänge gleich zum Markte

weh dem, der den Weg nicht weiß!

Morgen kann ein andrer Händler

Kaufen, was bald ihm geklaut.

Wir sind in der Meerjungfrau,

zechen, bis der Morgen graut!“

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="875">Located in a commercial area in the west of Admiralteyski, Spartak cinema is a center where much of the local youth meets, though it has lost importance with the emergence of the [[youth club]] to the south. Still, since the old theatre has been converted to a [[garbage-burning facility]], it has become the main cultural centre of western Admiralteyski. It tries to live up to this status by showing a wide variety of movies, though much of the avant-garde scene has moved on to smaller bars in the area.

The [[cinema Spirit|spirit]] of the cinema is very much alive and appears to be of Jaggling rank. Though the pack has made two deals with the spirit in the past (which turned out well), not much is known about it.

[[Angus]] runs a small [[cinema club]] that meets here once a month, part of a recent deal with the spirit.

      <comment>/* Sword */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15512">== Preparation ==

&quot;You got it?&quot; [[Angus]] asked. &quot;Yes, just arrived. I'm sending you the
files right now&quot; [[Edouard]] replied.  
''Claidheamh mòr and the Highland Problem'', by Alistair MacDuff.  
The only known copy of that
book was the private property of some obscure American industrialist
of Scottish descent. Angus had been able to pinpoint the location, but
he hadn't been able to get a copy. Edouard had, somehow. Only a
digital copy, probably photographed the pages, but that was enough,
Angus thought.

Angus sighed. He had read countless books and internet web pages on
Claymores since he had decided to get himself a sword for his next
Tribe meeting. And not just any sword would do, so he started to
research Scottish late-medieval swords. He felt a bit like one of
those American emigrants... being so far away from home and
frantically digging for some &quot;roots&quot;, something that would tell the
others that he was, indeed, Scottish. He had always despised the
Americans for digging in their family history, trying to find some --
''any'' -- weak link to Scottish ancestors and then proudly buying some
silly tartans from a web shop. And now he was in a similar position:
painstakingly analysing his family history, and trying to find the
best &quot;sword fit&quot; for him. 

== Steel == 

&quot;[[Grigori]], ever heard something about a ''tamahagame'' -- or
something similar?&quot; Angus asked his packmate. &quot;Sounds somewhat
familiar, in what context did you hear this?&quot; the knowledgeable
werewolf replied. &quot;You know the Claymore designs that we discussed a
few days back? I've decided on the type of sword I'd like and I'm
beginning to ask around what else I need. [[Shuro Koshonin]] told me
I'd need one of these tamahagames, and that I should talk to him once
I've found out what exactly that is. He can help me make one.&quot; -- &quot;Ah,
now I've got it. I saw a good documentary on Japanese sword-smiths
once. Tama-hagame is Japanese for jewel-steel, literally. It's a
traditional way of generating steel for their katana sword-smiths, I
think. It's supposed to be very pure, materially and
spiritually. Whatever those documentary film guys thought of as
spiritually pure, at least.&quot; Angus always wondered how the pack would
manage without Grigori. Ask him about ''anything'' and even if he
doesn't know the topic, he at least knows enough starters to get the
research going. Some kind of Japanese steel Shuro was talking about?
For a ''Scottish'' greatsword?

Angus met &quot;Dancing Shadow&quot; in the no-mans-land between the claimed
territory of their two packs. Although that no-mans-land was reduced
due to the [[Breeding Grounds|recent acquisitions of the
Shadowclaws]], it was still rather large. &quot;You've found out what I was
talking about?&quot; the wiry Hunter in Darkness asked. Angus nodded, &quot;It's
Japanese steel, what they used to smith their swords with&quot;. &quot;Not
entirely correct&quot;, Shuro answered, &quot;but it'll suffice. Tama-hagame is,
indeed, a Japanese type of steel, but it's a steel of the finest
quality. It's materially, and more importantly, spiritually pure. To
create tama-hagame, one needs to build a ''tatara'', a traditional
iron melting furnace and ask the Japanese gods to help and guide the
process. I know the ways and secrets to build a tatara. I can supply
the materials needed to create the steel. But I need someone who can
call the spirits and guide the rituals accompaigning the tatara. If
you are willing to help me on that count, then I will give you enough
steel to forge a sword -- even one as large as those greatswords you
Scotsmen cherish.&quot; 

---

It was cold outside. They were far away from [[Petersburg|St Petersburg]], in the
woods and wilderness. Angus saw a few men checking their tools,
stokes and shovels. He saw a huge pile of charcoal, of sand, of loose
earth, clay, wood, bricks lying around. The past days he had memorised his
part of this ritual: the calling and persuasion of the Japanese gods
to bless and purify the materials and the smelting process, above all
calling for the help of Kanayago, the patron Shinto deity of metal. 

Angus would need to stay here for many days -- he hoped that nothing
unforeseen would happen in his territory in this time. He started the
purification ritual and Shuro and his men would begin to build the
tatara. First, they would dig an underground structure, complete with
drains, air ducts and regulators. On top of that, ash and charcoal are
spread in layers, with Angus, the Hunter in Darkness, and the men
stomping on the ground to compact the mass. From clay, clay bricks are
produced and put on top of the coals. 

&quot;Now, the process begins&quot; Shuro smiled. &quot;You will need to help -- it
will take 72 hours during which we will not be able to sleep!&quot; A fire
was started under the clay bricks, and layer upon layer of sand and
charcoal is added to the tatara. Every half-hour Shuro would signal
the men that a new layer needed to be added. By now, the fire was
tremendously hot. Shuro checked the temperature by looking at the
colour of the flames and constantly increased or decreased it, to keep
an even temperature. 

After the three days and three nights were over, Shuro was content. He
had not spoken much during the long hours, but now he signalled to his
men to tear down the walls of the tatara. Inside, there was a large
piece of steel: nearly 2 metres in length, 1 metre wide and at least
20cm of height. Koshonin seemed content. &quot;This is the steel. Now we
wait for it to cool down, and I can then cut out the parts by
quality. You can now return to the city, I will bring you the promised
steel as soon as I have it done.&quot; 

== Fire == 

There had been a large fire somewhere in the territory. Angus had used
his contacts with [[Nievo Ashkov]] to find this out. He had been
waiting for this very occasion. [[Grigor]] was alrady informed and
they both knew what to do. A quick call and both werewolves were on
their way to the fire site. 

&quot;So we're doing this now?&quot; Grigor asked. &quot;Yes, let's get some fire
spirits into this box and then we need to go to the 
[[Spirits of Fire and Steel|Court of Fire and Steel]]... that'll 
be the more difficult
task!&quot; Grigor growled &quot;I know... you need me as a backup.&quot; --
&quot;Honestly? Grigor, if I can't talk with the Spirits of Fire and Steel,
there ''is'' no backup. I need you to get us both out of there alive,
then!&quot; 

They arrived at the fire. A large comerical building was up in
flames. Probably another of those gang violences, Angus thought. Well,
the fire is there, might as well get some use out of it! At least he
needn't start a fire himself, he was relieved. A quick look into the
spiritual world, and there were indeed a few fire spirits already
feeding on (or being born from) the fires. &quot;Right, let's move in
there!&quot; and he grabbed the box he had prepared already. The box,
marked with Uratha ward runes and which held a spirit of asbestos was to
hold the fire spirits, once he had bound them. Easy enough to build
that one, Angus thought. All too easy to get asbestos spirits from all
those old soviet-era buildings. &quot;Just check if anyone is looking, and
if they are, try and get the firemen to start on the other side of the
building&quot; Angus told the Rahu. Grigor nodded and moved forward. 

---

Returning with singed clothes, Angus nevertheless was content. &quot;I've
got them&quot;, he said to Grigor. &quot;Two Gafflings, let's hope that will be
enough!&quot; They returned to their headquarters, and entered the Shadow
World via the pack's [[Old radio|home locus]]. They changed into
Urshul and quickly made their way to the [[Heimeligkeitsfenster]]. The
pack did have access here, Angus thought, but at some time in the
future they'd have to start to claim the locus fully. It was just too
conveniently located, and too important strategically for both: the
pack and the court. 

They both stood at the locus, looking around. There usually was at
least one spirit of fire and steel around, even if the resonance of
the locus did not fit perfectly. And there it was. A towering being of
flames, growing by the second. &quot;You seem to want something&quot;, it
hissed, &quot;otherwise you wouldn't be standing here!&quot; The Ithaeur stepped
forward. &quot;Indeed I do. I need one of your kind to fire a forge.&quot; The
spirit came closer to Angus, the fire cracking and hissing around
him. Grigori stepped forward, but Angus motioned him to stay back. &quot;A
forge, you say?&quot; Ever closer the eyes came to the werewolf. &quot;A forge?
I assume you'll be smithing ''weapon'' then, eh? Now, normal weapons
would be used against humans, we have nothing against that. But a
forge? You'll be smithing archaic weapons... a sword?&quot; Angus
nodded. &quot;A sword it is... guns are used against humans. Swords, on the
other hand... swords are klaives, swords are used against spirits! Why
should we help you with that?&quot; Angus gulped. He had known this would
not be easy. Edouard would have been better at talking to the spirits,
in any case, but he wanted to do the main tasks mostly by himself. It
was supposed to be his sword, after all. He gave Grigor the signal and
the Blood Talon opened the container box he had been given by
Angus. &quot;Forging a sword, a steel sword by one of the finest
swordsmiths of our time, forging in the traditional manner. This will
take time and it will generate a lot of Essence. Essence of the fully
correct type you need. Essence you can keep all for yourself. Also, I
have these, which I would gift to your court&quot; -- Angus indicated to
the fire spirits held in the box -- &quot;for you to consume, or do
whatever you like with.&quot; The spirit moved to the box and greedily
looked inside. &quot;And, of course, I don't think I need to tell you this,
but the sword will be made in any case -- with, or without your
help. Wouldn't it be better for you to know exactly ''what'' kind of
sword was forged? Firsthand information? But you've probably seen that
already, haven't you?&quot; A hint of taunting lay in his words, Angus
couldn't refrain from that. It was time he learned a few negotiating
tricks from Edouard, he thought. 

---

The fire spirit stood for a while, quietly crackling and seemingly not
present. After a while, life came back to him, and a second fire
spirit arrived. Much larger, much more alive than the first one. &quot;We
agree&quot; the newly arrived Jaggling said. &quot;But you may only forge this one sword,
after which our brother will be free and you have to return him safely
here.&quot; Angus smiled &quot;If you promise to help fire a forge and smith one
sword to the very best of your abilities, I will promise that the fire
spirit will be returned to you in good health.&quot; He released the fire
spirits from his container, which were immediately consumed by the newly
arrived Jaggling. &quot;I will call on you once I have the forge set up.&quot;

== Sword ==

Well, time to get someone to actually ''make'' the sword then, Angus
thought. [[Aleksandr]] had been saying that some  Iron Masters were
actually craftsmen, that there was even an entire [[lodge]], the
[[smiths]], dedicated to craftsmanship and smithing in particular. The
Storm Lord went to visit his packmate in his home, and found the
Irraka sitting in front of his computer, wild and seemingly random
lines of letters and numbers flying past on the screens. &quot;Vodka?&quot;
Aleksandr asked. &quot;It's the newest Editor's Choice of ''Vodka Weekly''!&quot; 
Angus helped himself. 

&quot;So, you said a while back that some of your tribe are actually, you
know, literal masters of iron? Anyone here in St Petersburg that
could forge a sword for me?&quot; -- &quot;A swordsmith, he?&quot; Aleksandr
smiled. Storm Lords really were old-fashioned. He preferred a
submachinegun over a sword any time, but hey -- as long as his Alpha
got things working he couldn't complain. At least he need not fight
with him over who will get future weapon spoils then. Only with
Grigor, and that would be difficult enough... &quot;Well, there is a lodge
of Smiths. And the most legendary swordsmith, at least here in Europe,
is [[Smauri &quot;Forgesoul&quot; Ivarrson]]. He's old, very old. And no-one can
surpass his skill. He lives in recluse on Iceland nowadays, though. Not
much chance you can contact him, and he doesn't move any more.&quot; --
&quot;So, he can help me how?&quot; Angus interrupted. &quot;Well, he does have an
apprentice. Lukka &quot;Smoking Iron&quot; Holmsdottir is her name, I think. She
is looking to make her name as an excellent fetish-smith. I think
you'll like the price -- she does make excellent quality, but can't
charge accordingly, yet. She needs to build up a reputation that why
she offers to make klaives if the bearer will dedicate the first feat
done with the klaive to her, so that her tales of glory will
increase.&quot; -- &quot;Can you set up a meeting with her? You said she
travels, will she come to St Petersburg?&quot; Aleksandr nodded. &quot;I believe
I can set up a meeting, and yes, I believe she travels around the
world to seek new knowledge and traditional ways to forge weapons.&quot; 

---

&quot;You said that you had ''tamahagame''?&quot; Angus looked at the Iron
Master woman. She didn't seem the swordsmith-type. She was tall, but
slender. More wiry than muscular. He knew enough werewolves to not let
himself fool by appearances. &quot;I have. And a spirit of a steel forge
that will provide the fire needed.&quot; -- &quot;Can I see it? The
''tamahagame''?&quot; Angus shrugged, and stood up, getting the two small
iron cuboids he had gotten from Koshonin. He gave both to Lukka, whose
eyes widened as she reached for the metal. She closed her eyes while
feeling the surface of both metal pieces. &quot;One is the harder, and one
is the softer metal. I will forge both into many, many layers, so that
the resulting sword will be both hard and sharp, but at the same time
flexible, and won't break easily. Tamahagame... how did you get it?
The Japanese make so little of it nowadays, and they ''never'' let it
out of the country. And this is... correctly purified, I think. Not
made by mortals, I mean. It's perfect... have you got any more?&quot; Angus
didn't understand why the Iron Master got all excited over a piece of
metal. &quot;I don't have any more. If you're so interested in this, I
might be able to ask around, see if I can get some more.&quot; -- &quot;Do! This
much metal? You shouldn't be able to get this much outside of Japan.&quot; 

Angus showed her to the abandoned industry building where he had set
up a small forge. &quot;Will this do?&quot; he asked. &quot;The fire will be provided
a spirit, who will listen to your commands. It can be as hot, or as
cool, as you need it to be. Could you use this ice-water, and snow to
cool the finished blade? I might want to bind a storm, or an ice
spirit into it, and that might help. He had gone on another boating
trip to get large tanks full of icy Baltic water, and snow from
outside of St Petersburg. All stored in a large freezer now, here in
the building. Lukka nodded, and set herself to work. 

---

Lukka had called Angus on the phone. The sword was ready, she had
said. Angus held it in his hands. Judging by his (sparse) knowledge, a
fine blade indeed. At least it felt good, and was easy to wield. &quot;It
is done&quot; the smith said. &quot;Remember though, the first deed of that
sword is mine, not yours to claim!&quot; Angus nodded. &quot;I won't forget.&quot;
Lukka pointed to the sword. &quot;I consider it my finest work, yet. It is
perfect for a klaive, all the preparations, all the materials used,
spirits will die to be part of that klaive. It is ready. You can now
bind your spirits into it.&quot; 

The Storm Lord laughed. &quot;First, I need to learn how to use one of
these!&quot; And, still smiling, he left the building.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1557">Smauri Ivarrson is a legendary Iron Master belonging to the [[lodge]] of [[smiths]]. So great is his fame that he is known to Iron Masters in the whole of northern europe, though he has carved his territory on Iceland, where legend says he has a forge on the foot of a volcano, whose spirit is his totem. These rumours are likely over-the-top, but he is undoubtedly a master of his trade. Unusual for a werewolf, he has travelled much across the earth, seeking out old masters and young engineers alike to learn all he can about the art of forging steel. Smauri is old, though as with so many werewolves it is hard to estimate his true age. He has spend the last years looking for a worthy successor, and rumour says he has finally found one in young Lukka &quot;smoking iron&quot; Holmsdottir.

In the eyes of Forgesoul, Lukka still has to prove her worth by showing she also has the talent for producing fetish-blades that has made him famous. Iron Masters (or their friends) looking for a good blade often invite her to make it for them, for all she requires is that the first deed done with the blade is dedicated to her name, so that the Cahalunim sing praise of her skills and she may finally prove worthy to follow her master.

Of course, it is also a possibilty to seek out Smauri himself on Iceland, though the old werewolf is hard to find, surrounded by other packs that will likely not welcome travellers - and even if one where to find him, who knows what price such an exalted champion of the forge will charge?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1100">Yorek &quot;Howl-from-beyond&quot; is an ageing Ghost Wolf gone mad. It seems that he never was able to stay in a place for long, and therefore wandered the wide lands of Siberia for most of his life. During these travels he encountered an old castle, where he found a festering danger that would affect a large number of packs in the wider area. Unable to stop it, he  committed himself to slow it down, growing ever more desperate as he aged. No one knows how long he spend giving his shows, performing rituals that held it at bay.

At some point he must have felt that he could not hold on much longer, so he sought out his daughter to pass on the burden. Instead, he found the [[Shadowclaws]], who were able to [[the old werewolf's last play|resolve]] his problem with a concerted effort. Yorek went back to Siberia, and no one has heard of him since then. The story how he willingly gave his mind to stop a powerful spirit from passing into the world has been retold by [[Grigori]] and [[Edouard]], and is growing in popularity, especially among Ghost Wolves.

      <comment>more clarification</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5568">[[Angus]] was meditating when the door bell rang. He did not know how long it had been ringing before he noticed, but judging by the sour look [[Nievo Ashkov|Nievo]] gave him, it must have been a while. He had anticipated this meeting, yet he was uncertain wether he looked forward to it or dreaded it. Judging by the grim look of Nievo and the number of Vodka glasses he was silently emptying right now, Angus already knew what this was about. How could it have happened?

&quot;So...&quot;, Nievo began finally. Angus looked at him, trying not to betray any feelings. Again he wished for [[Edouard]]s talent in social interactions.

&quot;You like diving, da? You have been out there. Did you ... see the bodies? The family? Did you know the place?&quot;

Angus just shook his head, slowly, responding &quot;Went by boat all the time. Never set foot on land.&quot;

Nievo nodded, as if he already knew. Perhaps he already knew, though it hurt Angus a bit that Nievo still not fully trusted him. Then again, what could he expect? &quot;It's just ... I've seen the bodies. Of the policemen, at least. Some weird shit I tell you. Reminded me of some cases in this area. Where you now work, actually ...&quot; he let the sentence linger, but Angus did not respond. He just stared at the officer, trying to give him a blank look. It didn't work so well. &quot;Something isn't right, I tell you. Something is off, and not just off a bit, off by a gaping mile.&quot; He stared back at Angus but finally blinked and downed another Vodka.

&quot;Week's Favourite&quot;, Angus said.

Nievo smiled. &quot;You got your priorities sorted, don't you? Living in a hellhole but always supplied with the newest Vodka Weekly Favourite ...&quot;.

Angus smiled, too, and most of the awkwardness of the visit disappeared. Somehow, deep down, they both respected each other, though neither fully trusted his opposite. Probably it was their nature, Angus thought. Nievo would have made a fine Storm Lord if he'd had the blood.

&quot;The victim's bodies?&quot;, Angus enquired, though he already knew the answer.

&quot;Disposed of quickly&quot;, Nievo said, and now he just sounded tired, &quot;Seems the autopsy was clear.&quot; He softly shook his head, the motion already slowed a bit by the amount of vodka he had drunk since arriving. &quot;You don't even seem that surprised.&quot;

&quot;Been in the [[media:Zeitung9.pdf|papers]],&quot; Angus responded, &quot;trouble?&quot;

Nievo sat upright. &quot;Maybe. I need some info, and I thought you might know. Or know someone who knows. This Neighbours for Neighbours ... it smells. It stinks more than a metric fuckton of shit. No way they are behind all they get credit for. No way things just change like that ... you don't believe the papers either, do you?&quot;

Angus slowly shook his head. &quot;I put more faith in astrology then in the truth of Admiralteyski Wochenblatt. And I don't believe in any supernatural stuff ...&quot; Nievo smiled again. It seemed he valued the confirmation. Angus had to force down a smile. Nievo valued his opinion, sought his support? That was no small victory. &quot;I'll keep my ears open.&quot;, he told Nievo, &quot;And my eyes. If I run into anything strange, you'll be the first to know.&quot;

Nievo nodded, smiled, and stood up. &quot;Why don't I believe that second part?&quot;, he said. Angus just smiled the way he always smiled when he would not answer.

After Nievo left, Angus went back to his meditation. Just a few hours before, he had met [[Victor Flammendes-Schwert]] at the [[Bronze Horseman]]. The old Storm Lord had had some bad news. A pack of Forsaken had been wiped out to the northwest of the city. It seemed they had gotten themselves into a shootout with the police, which ended with the pack and a bunch of officers dead. He knew their leader had been headstrong, but still the story was odd. The papers sold it as a mafia incident, and Forsaken policy was to keep it as such. Yet the old Storm Lord was not only there about news. The reason for the fight was a police raid in the area, and while the raid had been carried out by local officers, the lead had come from inside the pack's territory: The bodies of the [[Eristoffs]] [[Breeding Grounds#First_Episode|abducted]] a few weeks ago had been found on the coast, and a trace had led the officers to the Forsaken. Angus' [[Shadowclaws|pack]] had made its own [[to serve and protect|coverup]] of the abductions, to protect the remaining family that still lived in the territory, so whoever was behind this must have known the truth. Yet how could the abducted Eristoffs, who had been taken by the Pure, show up dead deep inside Forsaken territory - and killed by firearms, no less, despite the Ivory Claws disdain of technology?

Trouble was brewing, and it appeared to be in connection with the Neighbours for Neighbours. And Victor made it clear that it was the pack's task to find out what was going on - it was their territory. For Angus, it was more than a task. The Forsaken killed were the pack that had found him after his [[First Change]]. Yet now he meditated to put those thoughts behind. Their deaths would be avenged, but that had to wait. The hunt for the remaining Rahglu took all his pack's concentration. If those stange things found another sanctuary in the area, he doubted the pack would be able to evict them again. The cellars of the [[St. Nicholaus Cathedral|cathedral]] were finally clear, but the queen was still missing. They needed to kill that queen, then the hive would scatter. And then, only then, they could finally do something about this strange Neighbours for Neighbours. He just had to hope it would not be to late.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2690">[[Grigor]] was sitting at the usual meeting place, poking around in his salad searching for bits of meat he would not even be able to eat. As usual, [[Vladimir Wecek]] was a bit late, but he was too important to complain about that. Grigor sometimes wondered what exactly Vladimir's position was - for a simple errant boy who passed on orders he was far to renowned and well connected. Then again, he had learned not to ask unnecessary questions in the Mafia.

A few minutes later, Vladimir entered the restaurant, nodding to a waitress who hurried into the kitchen to get the house special, a large steak with Russian potatoes. Grigor tried to look more enthusiastic about his salad, but Vladimir had tired of asking and simply raised an eyebrow.

&quot;To business.&quot;, he started. Now it was Grigor who raised an eyebrow, for Vladimir was not usually so brief. &quot;[[Neighbours for Neighbours]]. What do you know?&quot;

&quot;Strange fellows, neighbourhood watch scheme they say, but I guess there's more behind it. They once mugged a [[Aleksandr|friend]] of mine for being out late. There was also some [[Media:Zeitung9.pdf|bad press]] recently about some transgressions. Still it seems they are popular and have the support of [[Eris Bobrov]].&quot; Grigor recounted the facts, though he was certain it was no news for Vladimir. This was not about telling him something new, this was about showing he had a clue what was going on. And judging by Vladimir's nod, he had passed. Then he remembered something and smiled. &quot;And they don't like me.&quot;

&quot;Da. They are trespassing on our turf. Not a clever thing to do, but it seems they think themselves immune due to police support. They will find out they are not the only ones who can bribe the police. I want some of your boys to join those clowns. As soon as you find out who runs the show, come to me. Then we kill them.&quot; Vladimir talked in a casual tone, as if commenting on the weather. &quot;Take your time, just don't wait too long. The bosses are getting upset, and when they get upset, they take it out on me. Don't make me pass on that favour.&quot; He gave Grigor a wink, then stood up and left. Just when he reached the door, he turned around again. &quot;Ah, when you've made your choice, send me a list of who's coming along for the holiday special, da?&quot;

The door shut, and Grigor sat for some more time, pondering the brief meeting. The steak was brought and getting cold, but he knew fully well he had to resist that temptation. Time to go to the [[youth club]] and select a number of boys to send into danger. He knew that Vladimir would check the names he chose and compare with his reports on recruitment. Another test.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3186">It was getting late. Not only would [[Edouard]] have to spend the better part of the evening shuffling folders in his office, but with Ioann [[Eristoffs | Eristoff]] in jail it was high time that Ilpati Eristoff found a substitute for him. Ioann is far from incompetent, but as Edouard saw it, he was not able to keep things running all by himself. And after that [[Breeding Grounds|Raid of the Pure]] and the First Change of Ilya, the family should take some time to get acquainted to the new circumstances.

He sighed. Tomorrow would be another day, and he, too, should get acquainted to new circumstances, now that [[Alena Eristoff|Alena]] lived with him. It didn't help that he had to call her to delay dinner for a few hours, but it would be desasterous to her psyche if he would delay it for a second time on the same day. After all, he and his packmates tried hard enough to convince her to trust them.

Back home and after dinner, he turned to Alena. &quot;I still have some unfinished work left, and wondered if you could give me some advice about it.&quot;
Alena smiled a bit uncomfortable. &quot;Sorry Edouard, I'm still not used to your sense of humor. If you're telling a joke, you should at least try to make it sound funny.&quot;
Damn, where were his talking skills when he needed them. &quot;Erm, actually, I wasn't joking. Not much, anyway. I was thinking about the Eristoff family business...&quot; &quot;I don't know nothing about it, and I can't do anything about it.&quot; Alena interrupted.
Edouard just smiled at that and continued. &quot;Then just listen and tell me what you think about it. The business of your family has only been lead by family members. Ioann cannot lead the business, and Ilpati is a good leader, but I really doubt that he can manage affairs all by himself. There is just too much detail in everything, and he is not getting any younger. The day to day affairs seem to be going on quite well, but there is more to a flourishing business than that. As far as I know, there is nobody to fill that role. Would you .. erm ... would you be offended if I offered Ioann and Ilpati my assistance? I don't want you to think that we werewolfes are manipulative bastards who put their noses in places where they don't belong... ?&quot;

There was a long silence als Alena's expression changed from irritation to disbelief and on to amusement. Finally she just asked: &quot;Just out of curiosity, how many times before did you ask permission before getting involved in other people's business?&quot;

That took him completely by surprise. What was the matter with him? As long as he was in his territory, it was his duty to keep things smooth. And yet he somehow managed to make a complete fool of himself by asking this unnecessary question. &quot;This is a trick question, isn't it?&quot; Yep, his talking skills were slowly creeping back from wherever they were in hiding.

&quot;Sort of,&quot; Alena replied. &quot;But I can't think of any good reason as to why I could be offended because of that.&quot;
Edouard was relieved. &quot;When you come up with one, just let me know. I'll visit Ioann tomorrow morning and give Ilpati a call about it.&quot;

The second part is coming soon to a wiki near you...

[[Image:SeedBomb.gif|thumb|300px|Seed Bomb]]
[[Image:SeedBalls.jpg|thumb|300px|Seed Balls]]
== The Idea ==

&quot;Am I getting old...?&quot; Aleksandr asked himself. Gangs of kiddies raiding the streets. More children dying from drug abuse than ever. In the past, the adolescent weren't drifting and as hopeless as today, were they? He thought of his younger days. Ok, maybe they were. But he can not help the thought, that especially the lives of the kids are slowly falling apart in this part of town. Damn! We need metaphorical duct-tape.

What keeps the kids entertained? What gives them strength? Sports clubs don't cut it anymore. &quot;Uncool&quot;. Wind bands? &quot;Sooo 2001!&quot; They need a valve for their anger, need to physically exploit themselves. Put the pedal on the metal. How can this raw power be channeled? With the right tools, today's kids could tear whole streets apart. Sounds like fun, but is somewhat counterproductive. They need the seed of hope rather than bombs. Jeez! Aleksandr downed his half-full glass of vodka and rubbed his temples. Now it's getting ludicrous. After his first change, getting drunk is not as easy as it used to be. But an appropriate dose still gets his thoughts spinning. Time to go to bed.

Changing his clothes, he paused. Holes in the street. Seed of hope. Bombs. Seed-bombs. Aleksandr smirked and went to his laptop. Time for a new meme.

== The Meme ==

Graffiti combines mild vandalism and art. A nice way to express yourself, Aleksandr thought. But today graffiti is as ancient as cave-painting. A new idea must carry the same vibes but be more crazy; maybe combine something seemingly boring with going rogue. Plants and vandalism.

Ten fingers virtually fly across the keyboard. Vodka begone! A bottle of water is standing on the table now. After short hesitation, Aleksandr watered the dying pot plant from his sleeping room and put it on the table. Back on the laptop, he went to http://www.nic.ru/ to anonymously register a new domain. What name? Aleksandr pondered. It must have a martial sound to catch the attention of especially younger people. He tried &lt;i&gt;www.guerrilla-gardening.ru&lt;/i&gt;. Yes! Still available.

Maybe he should have discussed the details with the pack? Then again, a few days ago, he asked Angus about a new campaign to prettify the district. Mildly interested he mumbled: &quot;Make it happen.&quot; Well. I will.

The sound of clicking keyboard keys filled the room, while a new website evolved. Aleksandr chose a minimalist design, since the real action should take place on the streets. No forum, the organisation shall take place in real life. However, a photo album is mandatory, the people will want to keep record of their achievements. Tutorials are always welcome for the newcomers, so he included a manual for seed bombs: balloons filled with water, moss, fertiliser and seeds. Throw it - wham! Nature strikes back. What seeds? And what else to plant? How the fuck should he know?! Aleksandr sighed. This will need more investigation than he thought.

Six hours later, the website was finished. Thorough information about what seeds can grow where. Manuals for different techniques of flora-placement. A photo album, yet to be filled. Users can upload shots of their campaigns, pictures without plants will be deleted. And the manifesto of guerrilla-gardening.

At the crack of dawn, Aleksandr let himself drop on the bed. He fell asleep instantly.

== The Manifesto ==
* Colour your town! Get rid of the gray. There's an ugly empty space between two houses? Paint it red with a field of poppies. A boring concrete wall looks so much better covered in moss! You don't like how the city management neglects the parks? You can do better!

* Be creative! Fill the guildhall with pot plants, plant hemp in front of the police station or grow pumpkins on your balcony. Think out of the box.

* Choose your battle ground wisely! A tree right on the pavement will be removed, your art is destroyed. But what about the kerbstone or the central reserve...?

* Guerrilla gardeners are anonymous! Choose a nickname, disguise during your crusades for colour.

* Mark your art! Include your nickname in your opus, so that people will recognise you.

* Don't cross other art! Battle grounds of other guerrilla gardeners are off limits for a year. Choose your own spot!

* Spread the word! Tell other people about it. Work in teams, if you like. The more competition, the better!

* Upload pictures of your work at http://www.guerrilla-gardening.ru. Show the world what it means to fight for colour!

== The Seed Is Done ==
When Aleksandr awoke, it was already afternoon. After a fast breakfast, he went to the hardware store and bought a small oak tree, about 7&quot; high, a pickaxe and a stapler. He printed out a dozen small paper strips containing the address of the new website and stapled the to the trunk. Additionally, he added a carving: &quot;&lt;i&gt;Zephyros&lt;/i&gt;&quot;, his alter-ego he chose for this mission. He did not plan to use it much often, though.

A few hours later, already in the middle of the night, he was on his way to the main street of this quarter. Arriving there, he hesitated. What if no one will follow? What if this was all in vain? He looked at the pickaxe in his hand and smiled. Even then, he just had a good time. Aleksandr lifted the axe and stroke out.

When the first light of the sun hit the street, instead on asphalt, it fell on green leaves swishing in the breeze. In the middle of the street, right between the lanes there was an oak tree, a little taller than a man.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="940">Grigori is well respected for earning his [[St Petersburg Cultural Heritage Authority|employer]] an almost undisputed first place on the (highly informal) list of power drinking prowess amongst Europe's ranking Cultural Heritage Authorities (ever seen a French art history nerd, after half a bottle of vodka? You'd better have not). 

Clearly, it's all cheesy to praise someone for his aptitude in drinking. The more considerable advantage of creating such an image is that it gets Grigori some grip on other employees. Whenever there's some need to talk about things like [[Breeding Grounds#Act 4: Know your enemy|archaeological findings on the subway digging sites]], there's no need to elaborate a false pretence to talk to the official in charge. It's widely considered normal that Grigori knocks some colleagues door (with a bottle of vodka in his hands) and invites himself for a little chat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7243">After a [[Repercussions|recent discussion]] with [[Vladimir Wecek]], Grigor found that he had another job for his new Mafia recruits. This time, they would have to show more initiative and be able to work independently of him...

In the meantime, the Finnish contingent had grown to three lads. Grigor had just had a discussion with them in the basement of the new youth centre. He had judged Marko and the Ukrainians to be less suited to this particular job, and so had sent them off earlier on a simple errand to give a &quot;friendly reminder&quot; to a late payer. The new Finnish boy, Hirvo, seemed somewhat disturbed by the Rahu taking a sample of his blood and conducting some kind of occult rite, but Juha nudged him in warning that he should not say anything. Juha definitely seemed to be the smartest of the group, Grigor judged. If his family circumstances had been different, he thought to himself, Juha would probably have had a bright future ahead of him. Perhaps he could have studied some fancy shit like Grigori and gotten himself a cushy job. Instead... well, he still might have a bright future ahead of him, but then again there was a high &quot;attrition rate&quot; amongst Mafia greenhorns, especially these days.

It was about 11pm on one the bigger streets in the south of Admiraliteysky. The four of them -- the sinister-looking Rahu and the three young Finns -- were lurking on a corner, waiting to put the plan into action. Grigor shuffled impatiently. ''&quot;Are you sure this is on their route?&quot;'' he asked Juha, for the second time. ''&quot;Yes, boss. Should be, like last night.&quot;'' The Mafia man only harumphed in response, not completely conviced... Still, his doubts were misplaced, since the other Finnish boy, Niko, staring through binoculars, then announced ''&quot;It's them! They're coming this way...&quot;'' ''&quot;OK,&quot;'' barked Grigor, ''&quot;you two get into the bar, now!&quot;'' Juha and Niko sprinted a few steps and darted through the nearby door.

Grigor and Mirvo were alone on the corner. The boy was almost shivering with fright, staring into the Rahu's fierce eyes... ''&quot;Don't worry son, I'm not going to hurt you,'' Grigor said softly. ''&quot;You just need to fall over, like we talked about.&quot;'' They waited a few moments... ''&quot;OK, they should be able to see us about... now.&quot;'' He promptly grabbed Mirvo by his jacket and shunted him up against the wall. He held him there for a few seconds, before beginning with a few pulled punches and kicks. Mirvo recoiled and called out in mock pain. After the next fake punch, he fell to the ground. Grigor pretended to lay into him with kicks, as the lad called out for help. On cue, Juha and Niko re-emerged from the bar and glanced around in pretend confusion, while Grigor reached down and grabbed Mirvo's wallet.

The two guys approaching had distantly observed the altercation, as planned, and began to jog briskly in its direction. However, they were a hundred yards behind Juha and Niko. The two Finnish lads caught Grigor by &quot;surprise&quot; as he was fetching the wallet... Niko elbowed him in the head and Juha kneed him in the gut. ''&quot;C'mon, hit me harder!&quot;'' Grigor whispered, whilst feigning mock confusion. He had definitely told the two of them earlier that they shouldn't hold back! ''&quot;Seriously, don't worry about hurting me,&quot;'' Grigor had said then, ''&quot;hit me as absolutely motherfucking hard as you can. I mean it.&quot;''

The two boys began laying into Grigor with gusto, punching and kicking, and the Rahu made a show of defending himself weakly. Between hits, Juha was shouting out, loud enough so that the fast-approaching guys would be able to hear. ''&quot;You fuckin' thief! Leave our friend alone! Give him his fucking wallet back! You think you can just come down here and rob us?! Fuck you, you fuckin' thief!&quot;''

The two newcomers, fit-looking guys in their twenties, were now sprinting over, only a few dozen yards away. After a fairly robust hit from Niko, Grigor -- by now slightly battered and bruised -- allowed himself to fall to the ground. Just as the two guys arrived, Juha picked up the wallet and turned to greet them. ''&quot;Look, this bastard beat up Mirvo to take his wallet!&quot;'' Mirvo promptly got up and hugged him in gratitude, to illustrate the point.

The clean-shaven of the two guys, slightly out of breath, looked a little unsure. ''&quot;Who is he,&quot;'' he said, gesturing at Grigor, on the ground. ''&quot;Like I said, some fucking thief!&quot;'' Juha responded quickly, ''&quot;Look at that filthy thieving bastard!&quot;'' The unshaven guy grinned. ''&quot;Nice one,&quot;'' he said, ''&quot;looks like you beat us to it! Still,&quot;'' he added, slowly withdrawing a small club from the back of his jeans, ''&quot;you wouldn't want us to miss out on the fun as well, would you?&quot;'' His grin widened and he stepped over to Grigor. He dragged the unresisting Blood Talon to his feet. ''&quot;You thieving fuck!&quot;'' he spat in Grigor's face. ''&quot;We're watching these streets! You think you can just come along and rob some innocent kids on our patch?! Fuck you, pal. It's payback time!&quot;'' He smashed the club into the side of Grigor's head. The Rahu recoiled in pain, letting out a groan -- only half-acting this time -- and made a flimsy show of resisting...

The unshaven guy began to rain blows and kicks down on him, and Grigor allowed himself to slip to the floor again, as the clean-shaven man looked on with an indecipherable expression. Grigor felt Kuruth rising within him... This arrogant bullying bastard! Thinking he could really beat beat him with these weak-assed blows... He knew with certainty that he could turn the tide of this fight in an instant, and it would be that fucker who would be bleeding and begging for mercy, not him! Grigor growled in pain and frustration, and gave his all to restrain himself...

The rain of blows ended. Grigor, bloodied and battered, glared up at the leering guy with the club, memorising his face. Once his bosses had dealt with their bosses, he'd be back to clean up the rest of the garbage. And this particular ugly fucker would be first in line.

The more cultivated of the two guys turned to Juha and Niko. ''&quot;Looks like you two boys know how to look after yourselves. Impressive -- this sad fuck looks like he could have been dangerous,&quot;'' he said, nodding to Grigor. The club-wielding guy then dragged him a few steps away from the corner, into an alley, and left him lying there, seemingly half-dead.

Through one half-open blackened eye, the Rahu surreptitiously monitored the following conversation at the corner. Juha shook the man's hand. ''&quot;So, I guess you're with the [[Neighbours for Neighbours]] thing, yeah?&quot;'' The clean-shaven guy nodded. ''&quot;Yeah,&quot;'' Juha added, ''&quot;I heard about that. Nice. I'm pretty tired of these Mafia goons throwing their weight around.&quot;'' The man didn't seem to respond, so Juha added, ''&quot;Glad that people like you are starting to get organised and fight back.&quot;'' The two men glanced at each other and spent a brief moment in consideration. ''&quot;So,&quot;'' the clean-shaven one finally replied, ''&quot;you ever thought about joining us?&quot;''

Bingo. Juha and the other Finns were in. With his smarts, Juha ought to be able to turn up a few names before too long. Enough names to keep Vladimir happy, anyway.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2042">[[Grigor]] leads a number of young boys from the south of the [[Shadowclaws|pack's]] territory, working for the mafia.

After his first change, his position as a bouncer quickly became untenable, but luckily he emerged from the tumultuous first weeks with a good reputation for taking initiative - something that [[Vladimir Wecek]] told him his bosses were glad about, and he was assigned to the new [[youth club]] to recruit some young lads and whip them into shape. He has since succeeded in this, acquiring about a dozen followers, called the &quot;foreign legion&quot; since there are no native Russians among them.

All the boys from the foreign legion are quite young, in the range of 16 to 20. Without exception, they come from poor families living in one of the worst areas in the territory, and grew up spending lots of time on the streets. They see Grigor as a bit of a father figure, a strong hand that has finally given some purpose to their existence - even if that purpose is lying, stealing, violence and murder. It is no secret that all of them are more than a bit afraid of their leader, but they keep their mouths shut about his eccentricities.

Grigor has blood samples from all of his guys, and has tasted their blood so he can track them down fast. This has not been necessary yet, but as a precaution, it is certainly good. It is unknown how much Grigor's superiors know about his strange practices, or how much they care as long as he gets the jobs done.

Some are known by name:

{|cellpadding=5 | 
|-
!Name!! Age !! Nationality !! Short description

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1726">===Intro: A bar brawl===

Pack arrives at [[Café Alexanderplatz]] after a call from one of the [[Eristoffs]] to find a number of [[Rahglu]] well hidden in a barren at [[Wilhelmplatz]]. They drive them out in a fierce combat that almost kills [[Aleksandr]]

===Act 1: Old Grudges===

Investigating about barrens, their origin, how they can grow, the pack learns the most likely reason is a fight between Spirit Courts that drains the area of essence and spirits.

They discover that there is indeed a struggle behind it, between [[The Son and the Nephew]], but cannot uncover much about the spirits.

A combination of research and leg work reveals there is an old conflict behind the war in the spirit world, and also that the two spirits have strange numina that allow them to recruit local spirits for their cause.

===Interlude: Allegiance===

In a small melee in the Hisil, the pack learns that even they are not safe from this strange effect, though they retain much self-control: All but Aleksandr seem to have chosen sides unwittingly.

===Act 2: A debt settled===

The Shadowclaws dive into the weird world of spirit politics to find a way to stop the growth of the barren and reoccupy it, to deny access to the Rahglu (who seem to be stronger there).

After much discussion and frustration, a deal with the [[Court of Eternal Grace]] and [[Blood of the City]] emerges.

===Final: Duel at Dusk===

The conflict is defused, with both spirits agreeing (largely due to great persuasion by Edouard) to nominate a champion for a duel instead of fighting a prolonged war. [[Grigor]] beats his opponent, a greater Gaffling of a pick-up, in a spectacular brawl, resisting Kuruth twice.

Most spirits are greater Gafflings, but they are totally fixed on their sorroundings, ignorant to the going-ons outside their houses.

The court seems organised in &quot;neighbourhoods&quot;, which encompass all members in a certain area and are supposed to be able to communicate (painfully slowly). Most buildings of importance have spirits that leave this court to join a more active one; therefore there are almost no Jaggling members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1164">Fleshmade is a [[Spirits|spirit court]] nominally encompassing all items made by mankind. Since the court is quite new (it emerged during the final phases of industrialisation with the advent of mass production), this claim is quite far from reality: Everything that already existed belonged to other courts (mainly [[Blood of the City]] and [[Court of Eternal Grace]]). Thus the court started in a niche, encompassing the &quot;soulless&quot; mass-produced items. These have become very common, though, and so the Court has grown in power and seems to be among the top players today. It is still easy not to notice it, though.

Today, the spirits of the court usually belong to items that are considered to lack 'identity' (everything humans usually don't have a personal connection to), and associated conceptual spirits. Due to its (relatively) fast rise to power and conflicting claims, the court has many enemies, especially among the more powerful courts.

The pack has found the spirit of the pharmacy at [[Wilhelmplatz]] hiding as a Ridden. They gave it to [[Blood of the City]] to gain favour with the court.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="532">Legion is a [[Spirits|spirit court]] consisting of insects, invertebrae and associated concepts. It is easily overseen and likely not very powerful. Spirits of insects that work in groups or swarms can sometimes be found - they consist of hundreds of animals and move with a characteristic noise. For solitary insects, only rumours exist.

The pack has met one cockroach spirit during the events at [[Petersburg Wilhelmplatz]], but had no other contact with the court so far.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5178">&quot;Wakeup, breakfast is ready!&quot;. Edouard slowly woke up as Alena poked him with the new Admiralteyski Wochenblatt.

&quot;Wow, thanks. I'll be ready in a minute.&quot;

Later that breakfast, as Alena read through the newspaper, she said: &quot;Hm ... Neighbors for neighbors have opened their archives to the police. I wonder what kind of information they have collected. You do realize that they only have themselves as a supervisor and could be collecting tons of data without ever deleting it?&quot;

&quot;May be they do, maybe they don't. But I'd really like to know what they know. It could prove to be useful in the future. What else does it say about them?&quot;

&quot;Nothing specific,&quot; Alena replied. &quot;But there is the same ad that was in the last newspapers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Die Nachbarn für Nachbarn arbeiten weiter unermüdlich. In
einigen Jahren wird man sich an diesen historischen Moment
als den Beginn neuer Hoffnung für Admiralteyski erinnern.
Jetzt ist der rechte Moment einzusteigen - auch du kannst
helfen!&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Es gibt viele Möglichkeiten, für ’Nachbarn für Nachbarn’
aktiv zu werden. Wir suchen momentan vor Leute, die Erfahrung
mit der Arbeit auf der Straße haben. Wenn du Durchsetzungsvermögen und Courage hast und uns unterstützen
möchtest, melde dich! Auch Spender und Sponsoren sind jederzeit
willkommen. Wer namentlich genannt werden will,
wird sich in einer ’Danke!’-Kategorie wiederfinden. Stolze
Spender können ihre Unterstützung auch mit einem ’Nachbarn

&quot;Wir sind ganz normale Leute - daher geht unsere Stärke auch
von der Basis aus! Nachbarn für Nachbarn setzt sich aus
Ortsgruppen zusammen. Wer aktiv mithelfen will, der wendet
sich am besten an seine lokale Ortsgruppe, oder direkt
an uns, falls er eine neue gründen möchte. Die Arbeit für
’Nachbarn für Nachbarn’ ist ehrenamtlich, und jeder kann
helfen. Melde dich noch heute!&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Chiffre: 0190666999
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&quot;Do you think you can just walk up to them and ask them about their archives?&quot;

Edouard grinned. &quot;No, definitely not. And I don't have the time nor the inclination of walking the streets at night.&quot;

&quot;You don't?&quot; Alena gave him a surprised look.

&quot;Well, I do what I have to do, and I don't want them to interfere with my schedule. And I don't want you out there either. That's much too dangerous. As a non-profit organization they are bound to have some sort of secretary or bean counter smart ass. I'll volunteer to be his substitute. And if it fails, I can always donate a chunk of money. My tax adviser doesn't care as long as it is deductible. Or maybe you want the job? It would be a pity if you got bored to death.&quot;

&quot;Let's go easy on that one,&quot; Alena said. &quot;We should first find out if they actually need that sort of help.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough. I'll write them a letter.&quot;

Later that day, Edouard prepared the letter:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Dear fellow citizens,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I have seen your newpaper advertisments in the Admiralteyski Wochenblatt and have a few questions about the ways in which I can help you. Please give me a call under 0900-545569 so that we can further discuss my involvment.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Have a safe day&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Edouard Lambert
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two days later, the Lambert's phone rang. &quot;Good Morning Mr. Lambert. I'm Vlad Azarkh from Neighbours for Neighbours. If you have time at the moment, I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about our Neighbours for Neighbours.&quot;

&quot;Thank you for calling, Mr. Azarkh, &quot; Edouard replied. &quot;I have heard much about your work and as a caring Citizen of St. Petersburg I'd like to invest in the safety of my family. Let's say about five to ten thousand rubels a year. I'd have to consult with my tax advisor on the exact amount and it would also depend on how efficient Neighbours for Neighbours are at securing the safety of the city.&quot;

&quot;That is a very generous offer, Mr. Lambert and I can assure you that we will be putting it to good use. There will be an annual meeting for all our sponsors and interested citizens where we present our work and spendings. But let me tell you something. You seem to be interested in the big picture and development plans that are best discussed in a more relaxed atmosphere. A few times a year, our leading staff and friends are having a brunch to talk about more general ideas. You know, things that aren't decided yet, and topics where we think more work needs to be done, and such things. If you are interested, I'll put you on our list so that you get an invitation for the next meeting so that you can meet the people that handle your donation.&quot;

Edouard suppressed a small grin. &quot;My schedule is quite packed and I really regret that I don't have the time to get personally involved in Neighbours for Neighbours. But I really appreciate your offer of transparency. I suggest I will sort out the details of the donation with my advisor and I am looking forward to you invitation. I guess I will ask any questions personally at the brunch. Have a nice day.&quot;

Edouard hung up the phone and began typing an SMS to Angus: &quot;You'll never guess who is on the guest list for the brunch with sponsors for NfN.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1388">Two very weird [[spirits]] that are reflections of a riot at [[Wilhelmplatz]] some 150 years ago. They appear in the weeks preceding the anniversary of the riot and start recruiting local spirits to their cause. How exactly this recruitment works is unclear, but it is on a subconscious basis and even affects werewolves. Recruits feel a strong urge to fight for their master, and are usually motivated by a promise of essence and feeding opportunities. The two parties clash on the date at Wilhelmplatz, were many spirits are discorporated and the area is drained of essence. This has led to the formation of a Barren.

The followers of Son and Nephew consist entirely of Gafflings - it is unclear if this is due to the fact that Jagglings can feel the influence and leave the area beforehand or if they are immune. Still, the entire area is split among their followers and the widespread destruction will not spare anyone who declares no allegiance to either.

Following [[Petersburg Wilhelmplatz|recent events]], the combat between the two spirits has been ritualised, the pack providing a combatant and the price (a greater Gaffling). As such, the growth of the Barren has been stopped, yet there is still a spiritual wasteland that will take much effort to remove ... and it remains to be seen what becomes of the two spirits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="753">A [[spirits|court]] consisting of the spirits of larger animals (mainly cats, birds, dogs) that live in the city. The spirits are usually quite solitary (even the dogs) and quite paranoid. It is rumoured they will not accept gifts of essence, a behaviour stemming from a number of attempts by the city's population to kill their physical counterparts by laying out poisoned food.

The pack has good connections in particular to the [[Cat Spirits]], since their [[totem]] comes from this brood. The dogs are therefore natural opponents, while most birds seem content to ignore them.

This court has traditionally good ties with the [[Court of Eternal Grace]] --  a rare thing in the spirit world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1831">A small place in central [[Petersburg]]. It is largely unremarkable, especially when compared to the major attractions of the area, just a small square with three adjacent houses to the east, and roads to the north, south and west. Despite being situated in a solid middle-class neighbourhood, the place is in disrepair: There are cracks in the plaster, a tree in its centre has long withered, leaving a patch of mud that has been spilt out on the square by rain; two benches with broken boards are located next to the former green spot.

The houses at the square don't look much better: There is an old house, all entrances nailed shut, that looks close to collapsing; a pharmacy that has [[Petersburg Wilhelmplatz|just recently]] been closed, and an old café that has just recently been reopened. All the buildings are still in disrepair. There are no cobwebs or other signs of insects between the houses, everything just looks dead.

The destruction in the physical world has not progressed past the place: The houses on the other side of the road are in good condition, and the people that live there tend to just ignore the place.

In the Hisil, this is a barren, created by the endless fighting of [[the Son and the Nephew]]. The area of decay reaches just to the houses, but it's growth has been checked by the [[Shadowclaws]]. It is not entirely void of spirits, there is some essence to be found here, guarded in turns by the Shadowclaws and some [[Handmaidens of Bloodshed]] hired by the [[Blood of the City]].

With the recent opening of [[Café Alexanderplatz]], the spirit [[Kaffeehaus]] can be found floating in the Hisil, while some visitors find their way to the cozy café that totally confuses Germany and Austria, placing the Alexanderplatz, its namesake, in Vienna.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1695">A small café at the [[Wilhelmplatz]], financed by the [[Shadowclaws]] (read: [[Edouard]]). It has reopened after almost two decades, now ran by [[Lana Yakisovna]], the daughter of the previous owner who left after his wife committed suicide. She is a somewhat shy and unremarkable woman, but at least she is enthusiastic in running the café. She previously worked at a flower store, and as such the café sports extensive decoration - despite its ill state of repair.

The inside is decorated with pictures of the Alexanderplatz and some buildings in Vienna. There are descriptions explaining how the place in the german capital has been named after Zar Alexander by his nephew Kaiser Wilhelm, and how the city is famous for its Kaffeehaus-culture. So far, visitors have either not noticed or not pointed out the rather obvious geographical errors ... and the fact that the lightblue-white decorations of the tables is probably most common in Bavaria, which again has little geographical or cultural connection to either the Alexanderplatz, Vienna or a traditional Kaffehaus. Yet the atmosphere is nice, the owner is comitted (if not very skilled yet) and the coffee is quite cheap (and good), so there are few complaints.

There are usually not many visitors, likely due to the barren nature of the Wilhelmplatz, so until now it is a financial failure. The place has a spirit, [[Kaffeehaus]], and in the Hisil a combined effort with [[Blood of the City]] and Shadowclaws is made to remove the barren - a project that will not finish anytime soon, it seems.

[[Alena Eristoff]] is sometimes here to help, enjoying some time outside Edouard's place.

It previously was the spirit of another café that became collateral damage during [[the fate of The Bleeding Stone]]. The [[Shadowclaws|pack]] has convinced it to try and remove the barren; they have gathered and coerced spirits for its brood or for consumption and provided essence and security, both themselves and via a deal with [[Blood of the City]].

Kaffeehaus is of greater Gaffling rank, probably of medium power among greater Gafflings.

She used to work at a flower shop but now runs the [[Café Alexanderplatz]] with the help of the [[Shadowclaws]]. Her sudden change of work leaves her a bit stranded, but it seems she really enjoys taking over the café that her parents had run.

She might have a thing for [[Grigor]], leaving him red roses on his motorcycle.

Still, its influence stretches right to the current eastern border of the [[Shadowclaws]].

The spirit is very powerful, its name evokes a certain awe in the Hisil of Petersburg. According to [[Andrei Wind-in-den-Straßen]], it is of Greater Jaggling rank and he and his pack go to a certain length to prevent provocating it. He says the name is from a famous quote of the russian hero Alexander Nevsky, namesake of the bridge: &quot;He who comes to us with a sword, from a sword will perish.&quot;. The bridge feeds on all passing spirits, and it has a number of &quot;spirit packs&quot; at its service that drive or lure prey to the bridge, feeding on the scraps left by the powerful Jaggling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5070">&quot;Hey, do you want to do me a favour?&quot; [[Angus]] asked
[[Nadja]]. They had just returned from a night out at the
[[Spartak cinema]] and were sitting in her living room. &quot;And what,
specifically, did you have in mind?&quot; Nadja replied with an
alluring glint in her eyes while moving over to the Scot. &quot;You
don't have a regular job, do you?&quot; Nadja instantly lost her
glint was sobered up, looking somewhat disappointed. &quot;There is
this new café on the Wilhelmsplatz we're building up. I'm sure
they'll be looking for some waitresses or something. It's hard
to explain... we want to attract more spirits to that café and
you could keep an eye out for anything strange that
happens. Contact me, if things get out of hand. Plus, the girl
that owns the café I think has an unhealthy crush on [[Grigor]].&quot;
Nadja still went tense when this name fell, Angus
noticed. &quot;Perhaps that girl will need a BFF to talk to, or
something.&quot; 

Nadja didn't seem too convinced, but having something to do
would be nice, she thought. Still, it would get dangerous
possibly, and she didn't want to have any more dealings with
spirits than she could avoid. Not much point, though. Angus had
explained to her that her being a wolfblooded, spirits were
attracted to her. ''Things'' would just happen around her, and
there was nothing she could do against it. She could only be
prepared and hope for the best. &quot;I'll do it. I mean -- I'll try
it out. Give it a chance. If I don't like it, I'll quit.&quot; 

&quot;Fair enough&quot;, Angus answered. &quot;I can't ask for anything more. I
don't think there'll be a lot of problems, I'd just like to keep
an eye on that café. Oh, one more thing: that girl, the doesn't
know we're werewolves. ''Don't'' tell her. She doesn't even know
that I exist. We just want to build up the café and that's
it. Once that's done we can safely leave the area. Just keep
your eyes open, and stay safe, will you?&quot; 

Nadja nodded and sat on Angus' lap. &quot;Now, is there an additional
payment in it for me if I do you this favour... ?&quot; 

---

[[Aleksandr]] had told Angus where the computer nerds usually
meet up. After taking a look at the venue with his
Two-World-Eyes, Angus had indeed spotted a few Coffee spirits
loitering around in the spirit world. What better place to find
coffee spirits than a basement full of computer nerds? Angus
thought. They probably have two coffee machines for every hacker
in here... Binding a coffee spirit didn't prove difficult, but
the unique brand of spirits here meant that is was somewhat
infused with a spirit of addiction. That's probably a fairly
common thing, Angus thought. He'll need to separate the two
aspects to get the pure coffee spirit he could offer to the
[[Kaffeehaus]] spirit for consumption. 

A few roubles and a couple of bottles vodka later, Angus had
talked a few of the homeless around his home. One of the city's
drug care prevention centres was just what he needed. Plenty of
addiction spirits following the homeless, and even a larger one
in the centre. 

Angus quickly bound one of the lone addiction spirits he found
with the hobos in the basement of his house. He then entered the
Shadow World with both spirits -- the addiction and the coffee
spirit -- and went to the reflection of the drug centre. Getting
the attention of the larger spirit of the drug centre wasn't
difficult. &quot;What do you need... what do you want... what do
you... ''crave''... ?&quot; the spirit asked. &quot;I need for you to
purify this coffee spirit. Take out the addiction, and leave me
the pure coffee part.&quot; -- &quot;Awww, why you anyone want to do that?
Where's the ''fun'' in drinking coffee if you can't develop a
healthy habit of drinking it? How can you impress your friends
without the addiction, without the hunger, without the lust, or
the want for more? Meeting your friends in the morning and
saying `oooh, I really need this coffee now, or else I won't be
awake´? How will they respect you without it?&quot; Angus
sighed. He'd better be careful not to get lost in the addiction
spirit's words. &quot;Because, I give you what you crave, lust after,
or hunger for. You can keep the addiction part of the spirit,
and I'll even throw in this one lone addiction spirit as
well. What do you say -- the first one's always free?&quot; 

---

Angus entered the Barren in the Spirit World. Grey, bleak and
uninviting, though little patches of essence were sometimes
visible -- and Handmaidens patrolling the area. The café had a
tiny, tiny glimmer of essence. Kaffeehaus spirit was there,
watching over his café. Checking the physical world with his Two
World Eyes, Angus saw Nadja in the café, waiting for customers
to arrive. &quot;I have brought a coffee spirit to add to your court,
Kaffeehaus&quot; Angus started. &quot;And [[Grigori]] will start monthly
philosophical discussion rounds to lure in the bourgeoisie. I see
that the essence here is well-guarded?&quot; Angus was fully braced
for a long-winded discussion. Somehow, the Kaffeehaus spirit
delighted in talking in long, convulsed sentences. No matter, he
had enough time, this time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3724">The Wasteland, concrete desert, shades of gray. The absence of spirits in Hisil leaves our side of the gauntlet emotionally devastated. People fled the area, mostly without even knowing why. The empty houses and streets produce no essence, so why should the spirits come back? A vicious circle.

We have done our deal in the spirit world and we try to make the quarter attractive for people again. But still, the area is nothing like it was before. We can do more, need to do more to bring back life here.

Shovel: Check! Seedlings: Check! Fertilizer: Check! Winter is a hell of a time for planting, so gas-can and nozzle: Check! Yeah, that will be fun. The car is parked not too close, so it will be quite some way to walk. No moon disturbs the starry sky, although the smog of the city does its part to diminish the brilliance of the sparkling. Defective street lighting has its benefits, Aleksandr thought, hushing from shadow to shadow. Tonight, the Wilhelmplatz will be pimped. If Aleksandr only knew to what extent...

The square is empty, some few lights leak out of the surrounding windows. The shovel in his hand, Aleksandr started to remove the tiles of the pavement. Although they are a little weathered, the frozen ground had a tight grip on them. About twenty minutes later he managed to extract three tiles close to the houses. Bathed in sweat, he put the shovel away. That was the easy part. From the backpack Aleksandr summoned the gas-can. Like in the old days, he mumbled. But no, tonight is not about destruction. At least that was what he thought. The ignited flame of the gas-can tinted Aleksandrs face turquoise and he started melting the icy ground.

Carefully he put the ivy-seedlings into the ground, together with a little fertilizer for the spring. With small beads of glue he fixed the thin branches onto the walls. A few months later they will stick there on their own. Suddenly two beams of light cut into the Wilhelmplatz, followed by a sore roar. Aleksandr pressed himself onto the wall and held his breath. A huge truck drove onto the square, heading for the center. What on earth...? Aleksandr could not make out any details, but it seemed that one or more figures got out of the truck, depositing something on the square. Dumping trash? Here? Seemed like a strange idea. The figures got back inside and the vehicle moved slowly away. What the heck did they put there? Aleksandr squeezed his eyes and could make out a faint red glow on the object before a bright flash blinded him, followed by an ear deafening detonation. The shockwave swept across the square, hit his body and smashed him into the wall. Then there was darkness.

Aleksandr awoke in an awkward position. His joints were bent and twisted, like those of a puppet with cut strings. His scull felt too small for his throbbing brain, the piercing headache numbing his thoughts. What happened? Where was he? Aleksandr rubbet his temples. But apart from his condition something else was wrong. This looked like, yes, like the Wilhelmplatz. But since when... Aleksandrs eyes went big. Chunks of concrete and debris all over the place. Even more disturbing: A tree. A full blown, completely decorated Christmas Tree right in the crater in the middle of the square. Shiny red balls, candles, all the shebang. This is crazy. He leaned against the wall. In the beginning the Guerilla Gardening seemed like a nice idea. But this is way over the top. This is getting out of control.

Some people staring in disbelief. Sirens in the distance. Aleksandr just realized that his presence as well as his equipment may raise some uncomfortable questions. Quickly he grabbed his gear and limped away.

[[Category:Tales]]

The stag raced on up the hillside, its sweaty haunches steaming
from the freezing cold. Fleeing from the pack, its controlled
desperation somehow morphed into arrogance as it sprung up and
through the mist and undergrowth with renewed vigour. In its
moment of need, the creature seemed to be able to find another
gear, or some hidden reserve of energy. [[Grigor]], in a last burst
of effort, his legs already burning, made a last desperate
lunge... A surprisingly sturdy bush then threw itself in the
Urshul's path. A short stab of pain, a clumsy stumble, followed
by a steep scraping slide down through the frozen undergrowth,
ending with an ignominious splash into an icy stream.

The stag had vanished. Another failed hunt. The Grigor-wolf
grimaced and tried to shake the freezing water out of his fur,
limping out of the water. More fucking lentil soup tonight, then.
It was goddamn winter, how the hell did these fucking deer manage
to have so much speed and energy?!

His stomach grumbling with hunger and his teeth grinding with
frustration, Grigor mounted his Kawasaki, heading back in to
the city. He mashed the throttle and the bike responded with a
satisfying jolt of acceleration. The frost and trees to either
side rapidly receded in a blur. The answer was obvious: Speed!
More speed was needed. He had seen first-hand in some of his
encounters with the Pure how several of his comrades had
apparently learnt the secret of the incredible swiftness of
Father Wolf. Time for hime to get in on the act!


----


Bear's Bane emerged into Hisil by the [[Old radio]] and allowed
his senses to adjust to the eerie half-light. The eep-eeps
scattered and chattered and beeped incessantly, as always making
little sense to the Rahu. He ignored them and hustled outside,
sniffing at the cold, electric air of the shadow city. He tilted
his Urshul-head and peaked his ears. Was there perhaps the
faintest hint of a deep, grumbling menace? Somewhere, out in the
streets, the Trucks were prowling. He would have to be careful!
At some point those god-damn cargo-carriers and their Pure allies
would have to be smashed, but that goal was a long way off.
Tonight, he was hunting something a little more agile, inspired
by the climax of the pack's most
[[Petersburg Wilhelmplatz|recent exploits]]...

The gleaming purple porsche-spirit growled aggressively, its
bonnet-face grinning with the challenge. It then screamed up
the shadow street, towards its prey. This particular prey didn't
seem all that intimidated, however, and stood its ground. As the
rather formidable-looking Uratha loomed up ahead, it changed its
mind at the last moment and veered off with a skid to avoid the
collision. Hunting such a Forsaken might be a bit too much...

Anticipating this move, Grigor gave a mighty leap in the car's
direction, but the porsche laughed off the challenge, and easily
raced away from the lumbering Rahu. It screamed off around the
corner up ahead, dodged a few puffing buses and sped off into
the distance, leaving a trail of rubber.

The Rahu was not to be so easily deterred, however. Some time
later - he had been waiting and growling and grumbling
impatiently, hidden behind a stack of garbage containers
lurking by the edge of the street - the porsche spirit
reappeared.

Bear's Bane let fly with another huge leap, more accurate
this time... The tumbling figure of fur and sinew and teeth
landed on the bonnet of the porsche with an almighty smash,
leaving a sizeable dent. The car-spirit let out a hiss of surprise
and annoyance from its engine, and promptly swerved. Grigor dug
in his claws and held on for dear life... The vehicle then let
loose on a frenzied drive, veering and thrashly wildly to try and
throw off its unwelcome passenger. The Uratha held on grimly. The
car smashed him into other vehicles and walls with crunching
blows, but he gritted his teeth and soaked up the damage...

Eventually, its engine beginning to get uncomfortably hot,
leaking steam and oil, the porsche powered down and glided to
a halt. Grigor cautiously dismounted and hooked his arm around
one of its doors, holding it still.

''&quot;Grrr. Alright, what is it then, Uratha?!&quot;'' the car asked testily.
Still bashed and breathless, Grigor took a moment or two to
respond. ''&quot;Your speed,&quot;'' he gasped, ''&quot;tell me how it's done. I won't let you go until you do.&quot;'' ''&quot;Hah!&quot;'' The car snorted.
''&quot;Easy. I just push it into top gear. Like this!&quot;'' The
gearstick suddently shifted itself and the engine roared
lustily, to illustrate the point. The vehicle tugged ahead,
but still Grigor held it in place. ''&quot;Nice try,&quot;'' the Rahu
growled, ''&quot;but you're going to show me, even if it takes all night!&quot;''

Somewhere far, far away, Father Wolf looked on and
consented to give his blessing.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4047">Following dreams about a legendary [[Shadowcall|artifact]], [[Grigori]] and [[Aleksandr]] set out towards the Hisil of the [[Twin Palaces]] to investigate. Meet up with members from all other packs, who are following similar visions. Attacked by a flood of spirits from the [[Roter Hof|red court]], who threaten to overwhelm the werewolves. A [[the maiden|strange spirit]] shows up, turning the tide of battle through her mere presence.

[[Grigor]] and [[Aleksandr]] get lost in the Hisil of the place, drawing in the rest of the pack. After a long journey through an insane number of pockets containing reflections from throughout the history of the palaces, they finally arrive at the lair of the spirit, together with members from other packs who also seek to win the spirit's favour - the spirit decrees that only one can do so. Tension rises when a howl rips through the Hisil: [[Taras Mihailov]] from [[Crimson Tears]] was murdered by [[Shuro Koshonin]]. His packmate present, [[Arja Haajanen]], immediately enters Kuruth and attacks [[Vanka Iosiforna]] of [[Glasfelle]]. The pack intervenes as the spirit withdraws in disgust.

As all packs work to win the favour of the spirit, violence spirals out of control. The [[Shadowclaws]] and [[Victor Flammendes-Schwert]] manage to convince Glasfelle and Crimson Tears to attend a High Court, yet the rivalry between packs escalates even further. Finally, fed up with the infighting that could ruin the high court and bring down the [[alliance]], Victor convinces the pack that the spirit should be discorporated to get the Forsaken to stop their infighting. Then, after the violence had settled down, could the packs resume to win her favour.

A number of Forsaken which managed to keep their cool gatheres under the Banner of the [[Enlightened]]: Victor and [[Boris Negarov|Blutfaust]] from [[Schatten der Zaren]], [[Vanya Sokolow]] and [[Yelena Dimitrovna]] of Litanei der Straßen as well as [[Grigor]] and [[Angus]] from the Shadowclaws. On their way, they encounter Arja, who seemed to be going after the same thing on her own.

When they enter the lair of the maiden, they are faced by a number of guardian spirits in the form of russian greencoats, who immediately opened fire. Yet the spirits were no challenge to the power of the Forsaken, as Blutfaust alone ripped through them as if they were wet paper, while Grigor and Yelena went for the maiden. Striking her, they noted that blows seemed to get deflected into the walls, ground and ceiling of the room.

It took the Forsaken some time to figure it out, but finally Angus, [[Edouard]] and Aleksandr noticed the similarity to the tale of [[the Bleeding Stone]]: A beautiful maiden, sought after by everyone, sentenced to death because of the trouble the infighting of her suitors caused and being saved by the stones themselves taking the killing blow.

As realisation dawned on the werewolves, the maiden discorporated with the pitiful rest of the defenders, and a loud clap could be heard from a balcony overlooking the room. There, [[Prince Yaromir]] was standing, smiling. &quot;It took you some time, but it seems you got there in the end. I must thank all of you for participating. With the events so vividly played out in the present, the allegiance of the Bleeding Stone will no longer be in question.&quot; He nodded to the werewolves as he headed for the door. &quot;You will excuse me now.&quot;

The werewolves, some quite upset at being played so thoroughly, left the Hisil. Four days later, the High Court spoke in favour of Shuro, after an argument between Arja and [[Sergei Grigorovich|Boneblade]] in the course of which the Rahu left the scene. The feud seemed settled, yet everyone knew that Boneblade would not let it die that easily.

As the Forsaken went home from the meeting, Grigori realised one point from the tale that had been overlooked so far, an obvious flaw in Victor's plan: In the legend of the Bleeding Stone, the maiden disappeared after her rescue, never to be seen again ...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1289">The maiden is a greater Jaggling of pure beauty - a very rare breed of spirit associated with truth, purity and beauty. Her mere presence seems to have a strong impact on spirits of negative emotions, and it appears she has Numina capable of freeing a werewolf from the grip of Kuruth.

Spirits of positive emotions or concepts are rather rare in the Hisil of the World of Darkness, and usually have a slim chance of existing for any prolonged period. There are just to many spirits of opposing concepts that ruthlessly hunt and destroy them. Finding even a lesser Jaggling from those ranks is no easy task, so she is probably the only greater Jaggling of her choir in western (or even all of) russia.

The maiden belongs to the [[court of Eternal Grace]] and is hidden in a complicated web of pockets in the Hisil of the [[Twin Palaces]]. It appears her combat capabilities are rather weak for a greater Jaggling.

She was recently involved in a [[reality theatre|play]] staged by [[Prince Yaromir]], another Jaggling of her court, designed to bring [[the Bleeding Stone]] over to the court. Strangely enough, [[Angus]] learned that another name for her might be [[Eternal Grace]], a name that also applies to [[Prince Yaromir]].

      <comment>another retreat of the CoEG</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1646">On the bank of the Fontanka River in the east of the old town centre, close to the territories of [[Glasfelle]] and [[Crimson Tears]], are two old palaces called Anitschkov and Shuvalov Palace. They have both seen a lot of use throughout history, the more splendidly furnished Anitschkov Palace currently serving as a conference center for international conferences, while Shuvalov Palace is a youth centre where concerts and other events are regularly held.

Anitschkov Palace was formerly the &quot;House of International Cooperation&quot; and still has a very calm and friendly resonance, while Shuvalov Palace long served as the headquarters of the &quot;young pioneers&quot;, and has a correspondingly bland resonance. The palaces are connected by an extensive park.

In the Hisil, there are a huge number of overlapping reflections of the park and palaces, representing different episodes of their history. It is very easy to get lost in the labyrinth of hallways, corridors and rooms. Not all of the various inhabitants are friendly, especially not towards werewolves, so it is inadvisable to enter this labyrinth on ones own. It seems that the geometry of the labyrinth, while certainly weird, seems not to be changing (at least not constantly), so it is possible to navigate the maze.

At the heart of the palace hisil, in a splendid ballroom, sits the spirit who owns this area, called [[the maiden]]. She is fiercely protected by her various followers, in particular by a number of greater gafflings appearing in the form of guards. The spirit - and therefore the area - belong to the [[court of Eternal Grace]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6739">Light flashed in rhythm to the loud beat as [[Aleksandr]] entered the club. It was one of the many middle-class techno clubs found in this part of the town, west of the territory of [[Schatten der Zaren]]. His eyes took a bit of time adjusting from the darkness outside, then he set off to find [[Yelena Petrova]]. It would be no use trying to call her cell phone in this infernal noise.

After some time, he found the young werewolf on the dancefloor. She smiled at him and moved over, brushing a string of hair out of her face. Sweat was glistening on her skin.

''&quot;Hey Aleksandr!&quot;''

Yelena had to scream to make herself heard. At least there would be no eavesdroppers. He raised a hand in greeting while she glanced to the flashing disco ball on the ceiling. Her mouth moved, but he could not make out any words. Then she looked back at him.

''&quot;Come dance, it'll be a while before he contacts us. No reason not to have some fun in the meantime.&quot;''

Aleksandr waited briefly if she'd explain herself further, but as that didn't seem to be the case he just joined her on the crowded dancefloor. The crowd closed in on him, and he smiled as he tried to imagine how they would have reacted if Grigor or even Bloodfist was in his place. He'd likely have half the dancefloor to himself.

He must have been dancing for at least half an hour when Yelena finally touched his shoulder and nodded towards the northern end of the club. Aleksandr followed her, pushing his way through the mass of bodies. He felt his anger rise as an elbow hit him in the side. ''Lose control in here and there will be a bloodbath'', he thought. Then they left the dancefloor and the crowd grew thinner. Yelena stood next to him, pointing at the northern wall. She was screaming at him, but he couldn't make out the words over the noise of music and crowd. All he could see was a screen covering part of the wall, showing some weird psychedelic video. At least it wasn't a cheap porno. Again Yelena screamed something, and again most of it was swallowed by background noise. Did she say Hisil? He concentrated, blinked and tried to look at the other side of the gauntlet. There were spirits here, likely feeding on the emotions of the densely packed crowd. Then he noticed. The screen was suspiciously clear. It showed a man, standing in a crowd just like them, looking straight at him. When he spoke, the noise kind of faded to the background.

''&quot;Aleksandr, I take it? Welcome to the lodge of Lightning. My Name is [[André Fazegas]]. I take it you contacted us with a purpose?&quot;''

The noise went loud again while Aleksandr stood there, watching the screen and the crowd. No one seemed to take note. Why would they? People looking wide-eyed at the screen, even speaking to themselves, were hardly conspicuous in a place where half the crowd was under the influence of whatever drugs they could get. When he began to talk, he could again hear the noise fading to the background.

''&quot;So far I have -of course- heard some things about the 'Lodge of Lightning'. At least enough to trigger serious interest. Now is the time to separate fact from fiction, rumours from the truth. What does the 'Lodge of Lightning' stand for? What is expected from their members? How can the Lodge benefit from me? How do their members benefit from the Lodge? What is necessary to join?&quot;''

André smiled.

''&quot;That is a lot of question. I'll try and make it brief.''

''We are one of the youngest lodges among the Forsaken, founded when electricity began to see wide-spread use. Yet we have changed the most in our history. That alone should tell you much about us. This world we live in is not the same the generation before us had to endure. Nor will it be for those who come after us. Everything changes quickly these days. As Iron Masters, we are of a tribe that has always been open to change. Our lodge emphasises this aspect. We don't strive to adapt to conditions when they have changed. We strive to adapt before they do. Take the internet, for example. It has changed the world in more ways than anyone can imagine. It has changed the Hisil as well. Many phenomena are no longer local, nor can they be kept local. We were the first to realise that, before social networks even started, before twitter or youtube or whatnot. What you witness now is one of our adaptions. We stay in touch, around the world, on a channel no hacker is ever gonna crack. If something new shows in the Hisil, we are the first to know. It might give you the one extra hour you need before it hits your city.''

''So, what do we want from our members? To live the ideal, as good as you can. Try to predict the changes, be ready when they hit. Try to learn the difference between an odd occurence that is not going to repeat itself and a new danger that might spread through the Hisil like a wildfire. You are an Irraka, right? Your job is to be out and about, picking up on the newest developments, crushing problems before they even arise. There is a lot of new technology that makes this easier. Don't make the mistake of assuming it's all limited to the world you were born in. Oh, and most of all, be ready. Every ready. The city never sleeps.''

''That is how we will benefit from you. If you pick up something new, something that will affect more than your territory, don't just warn your pack. Share it with us. Maybe we can help work out a response. If not, at least it will give us time to prepare. Stay in touch. It's the same way that you will benefit from us. We stay in touch. You might get an early warning about something that might have otherwise hit you out of nowhere. You might get the ban to that new und unknown spirit threatening your locus. Oh, and we can help you learn ways to use all the new gadgets. In this world, and in the Hisil.''

''So that's that. Guess now you think about if you're still interested, and if you are you just call me back. Have fun, kids.&quot;''

Without warning, the screen went black, and the noise crashed in around Aleksandr like a wave. The meeting was over. Looking around, Aleksandr noticed that Yelena had already started moving back to the dancefloor. The night was still young.

Hours later, Aleksandr left the club, heading back to [[Shadowclaws|Shadowclaw]] territory. His ears were still buzzing from the noise, but he knew he'd be fine in a couple minutes. There were some definite advantages to being a werewolf. André had not explained how exactly their communication had worked, but Aleksandr already had some ideas. And that, after all, was going to be his test. He smiled when he thought about the last words from André. It was such a typical way for Iron Masters to state their challenge.

      <comment>quite some typo ... distungly?</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5324">[[Edouard]] entered the hotel lobby, putting up his usual smile. He looked around, trying to figure out who the people here where. Finding out who sponsored [[Neighbours for Neighbours]] should give him a first lead on what they were up to. For a simple neighbourhood watch scheme, they were far to well organised and connected. [[Vanka Iosiforna|Whisper-in-the-night]] tugged on his arm, calling his attention over to a man who stood a bit to the side. [[Eris Bobrov]], head of [[Admiralteyski Police Department]] East. What on earth was he doing here? The evening promised to be interesting ...

The invitation had reached him a week ago. An invitation to a gala dinner, to give the top sponsors of Neighbours for Neighbours an impression of how much good their donations did. And to collect some more donations, of course. He had briefly considered taking [[Alena Eristoff]] with him, but then decided otherwise. He did not want her involved, and he remembered his mentor repeatedly asking him about his progress with Neighbours for Neighbours. It seemed they were a nuisance in the [[Glasfelle]] territory, too. So he offered her to accompany him.

His worries that Alena might be envious proved wrong. She even offered to give Whisper-in-the-night a crash course in 'how on earth you walk in these fucking shoes', and went looking for a dress with her. It took him some time to realise that Alena was familiar enough with werewolves to know that he'd be betraying far more than her trust with Vanka.

So now here they were, two Shepherds among the herd, looking for signs of trouble. And the presence of a simple police officer among the rich elite was certainly one. As they took their place at a table, Edouard again went over some of the more refined rules of etiquette for the evening. After all, they did not want to draw any undue attention, and he could see that Vanka felt totally out of place. Then the opening ceremony started with a speech by some guy in a disgustingly expensive suit. Edouard needed a moment to recall the face, then it hit him. It was none other than [[Miika Kovalov]], owner of several magazines, newspapers and TV channels. [[Admiralteyski Wochenblatt]] was among them. No wonder they were so infatuated with Neighbours for Neighbours.

In the course of the evening, Edouard more than once noticed Miika talking to Eris. Sadly, he was not able to find out what exactly it was they had to discuss. Still, he could get a good picture of the people at the dinner. There were the usual suspects, the socialites you could find at almost any dinner from any organisation. But there were also more men like Miika who, while not quite as filthy rich, all had at least some vested interest in the area Neighbours for Neighbours operated in. Shopping malls, bureau centers, clubs and discos - you name it, someone here probably owned one of those things in central Admiralteyski. And most of them were the kind of man who wouldn't mind a couple bodies on his conscience if it increased his profit. Petersburg's economy was a harsh plaster.

They left the dinner with most of the other patrons. Staying too long would undoubtedly have drawn attention. On the taxi home, little was said. Both he and Vanka were sufficiently paranoid not to trust the driver. When they had left the cab between their respective territory, Vanka waited until the cab had pulled away, glanced around to make sure there were no observers, then shifted to Dalu simply ripping through her dress.

''&quot;Boy are those things uncomfortable. I sure hope they don't plan another dinner anytime soon.&quot;''

She smiled as Edouard cringed. That dress had cost more than Vanka earned in a year.

''&quot;I have to say I'm impressed. You got an in to these Neighbours that would have been completely out of my reach. Seems there is more you can get from the rich than just money.&quot;''

Edouard nodded. ''&quot;It seems they have a nice scheme running here. Probably offering increased protection to their top sponsors. Building a small private army to make sure they're safe from thugs.&quot;''

''&quot;There's more.&quot;'', Vanka repiled. ''&quot;There's been some really unpleasant incidents with some of the local shop owners. Neighbours for Neighbours were there and caught the villains, but only after the damage was done. Seems they use them to get rid of unwanted competition, too.&quot;''

''&quot;Makes sense. I wonder, though, how the Mafia is going to react. Bullying small business is their territory, after all.&quot;''

''&quot;We'll see. The Neighbours are on good terms with the police. I wonder what Eris' profit in this is. Probably fast promotion. Probably more. I'll keep my ears open.&quot;''

''&quot;And I'll check how deep the impact on the local economy already is. Should we do anything against them?&quot;''

''&quot;Not yet. I want to get to the core of this. If we strike premature we'll just provoke a war. Perhaps we can cut their heart out without causing any trouble.&quot;''

''&quot;Ok. I'll hear from you.&quot;'' Edouard turned to walk back to his flat. A bit of cold air to clear his thoughts would be perfect now. He really lusted for a deer or similar prey to cross his path, but he knew the likelyhood of that in a metropolis like Petersburg. After a few steps, Vanka called after him.

''&quot;Edouard! One more thing. Welcome to the lodge.&quot;''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10244">== Friendship == 

[[Nievo Ashkov| Nievo]], the police head of the district was at [[Angus]]' door again. He
still wore his uniform, and had with him a smallish parcel. Angus
invited him in.

As they sat down with the customary glass of Vodka Weekly's
Weekly Favourite, Nievo opened the box, and handed the contents
to Angus. &quot;You know what this is?&quot; he asked. &quot;A broken bottle?&quot;
Angus replied cautiously. Nievo snorted. &quot;Well, obviously. But
take a look at the bottle, anything you notice out of the
ordinary?&quot;

It indeed was a broken bottle, greenish, seemingly old, with the
bottom part broken off. The glass was stained and dirty from
then outside, but impeccable from the inside. More staggering
was the label: it was still in perfect condition, denoting this
in lovingly careful hand-written old script as a bottle of
Glenavon whisky, dated from 1882! Angus' hands began to
tremble... He looked up to Nievo with a disbelieving look in his
eye. &quot;What is this? Is this true? A joke?&quot; -- &quot;That's what I
hoped you could tell me, Angus,&quot; Nievo replied. &quot;The bottle was
part of a small shipment that was found in a sunken ship a few
weeks ago -- you might have read about it in the papers? This
old merchantman that was sunk in the Baltic in the late 19th
century? The shipment included a few boxes of these whisky
bottles, so we believe them to be authentic. We're currently
investigating them, but the distillery no longer
exists. Ballindalloch is the name of the village were the
distillery was situated, so much have found out. We also believe
it to be a bottle of Glenavon, a distillery that shut down in
the very early 20th century.&quot;

&quot;But there's a larger story to this... if you're willing to give
me the benefit of doubt?&quot; The policeman looked at Angus, who
smiled in return. &quot;Naturally, Nievo. You know this!&quot; Ashkov
seemed relieved. &quot;So, the thing is quite strange. The boxes of
whisky were sent to us to keep safe in the evidence vault until
those politicians higher up decided what to do with them. Most
probably they're still fighting who gets to 'own' the
bottles... they're incredibly valuable, or so I've been told.&quot;
The Scot nodded: &quot;Yes, I've read recently that an old bottle of
whisky was auctioned off for more than 10,000 dollars. Depending
on the type and quality of these, each could be worth much
more!&quot; He tried to tip the bottle to see if any liquid was
left. Nievo laughed, &quot;haha, don't try... there's nothing left of
the contents of this bottle!&quot;  Disappointed, Angus took his
glass of vodka instead.

&quot;Now, these bottles were in our vault,&quot; Nievo continued. &quot;And
one day, I got called to the station. Apparently, two policemen
had entered the vault, to take a closer look at those
bottles. One of them then suddenly attacked the other with this
very bottle here. The victim is still in hospital, and the
attacker cannot remember a thing. Precinct talk is, the vault is
hexed, and nobody wants to enter it any more. Hah!&quot;

Angus took the opportunity to quickly scan the bottle with his
Two-World Eyes. Nievo's story sounded suspiciously like spirit
world involvement. But, nothing was visible on the
bottle. Probably a spirit with the collection, he
thought. Meanwhile, Nievo continued his tale. &quot;You know me,
Angus, I don't believe in these things. Hexes, curses... anyway,
I went into the room to see for myself. And -- nothing
happened. But mark my words, I am ''certain'' somebody, or
something, was in that very room with me, watching me. Nobody
was there, not a single living soul with me in that room. But I
swear I was being watched. I've been on the streets too long to
not notice these kind of things. Do you believe me?&quot;

Angus didn't know how much he should open up to Nievo. They've
been friends for some time, and both knew that the other party
withheld information that might jeopardise their relationship,
or cause trouble for the other. Both respected the other's
commitment and knew their limits. It was an unspoken part of
their friendship, a &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy. Angus could
tell Nievo was worried, otherwise he wouldn't have brought this
up to him. There must be a lot going on in the precinct now on
this... In the end, Angus opted for a non-committal approach that
would still allow him to see for himself what was going on:
&quot;Nievo, you know I trust you and your instincts. I have no
reason not to believe you! Hm, let me see, do you think you
could arrange for me to have a look as well?&quot;

== Emnity == 

Nievo had arranged for Angus to look at the evidence vault
undisturbed. No need to bring in any more visitors -- and
witnesses -- than necessary, if what the werewolf assumed about
the vault was true.

Angus entered the room, and there was nothing out of the
ordinary to be seen -- at first. Shelves stacked full of boxes,
plastic containers, some weapons, all sorts of things. At the
left end, just as Nievo had said, two boxes containing a number
of bottles. Bottles of whiskey, identical to the broken one
Nievo had brought with him. No-one was in the room, and Angus
quickly checked with his Two-World Eyes... some spiritual
activity in the shadow world, but nothing out of the
ordinary for such a site. 

It must be in Twilight, thought Angus, shifting his senses into
the ''shurilam''. Indeed, there it was -- a spirit hovering over
the bottles. Nievo must have extraordinary instincts, the Scot
thought. Not many mundanes could sense a spirit in Twilight! 

&quot;Half-flesh!&quot; The spirit exclaimed. &quot;Do not come near me! Do
not come near my children! They are all I have left, and they
will last for ever! For ever I tell you! I have seen what these
people want from me, they value my children. But they will not
have them. They are mine! Every year I can guard them, each
additional year will add to their worth. They are mine, mine,
mine alone, and none shall have them until they are hundreds,
hundreds of years old. And then, no-one will open them, everyone
will worship them, and place them in museums, behind glass, to
venerate them. No-one will want to do such a base thing as
''drink'' my children! Noooo, they are then too precious!&quot; 

Angus could quite sense what type of spirit it was. It was
evidently even madder than the usual spirits he knew and
conversed with. Locked away under the water, in a shipwreck for
nearly one hundred years would probably drive everyone insane,
the werewolf thought. It would have to be some kind of whisky
spirit, referring to the bottles as his &quot;children&quot;, Angus
assumed. Driven mad by years of being locked in a shipwreck?
Does that even make sense, Angus thought? 

&quot;I am not here for your children, I am here for you. You cannot
protect your children for ever, and you cannot protect them
here. This is not your place to be!&quot; -- &quot;Of course I can protect
them, they are all I have left! There used to be a time, when me
and my friends would nurture our children, watch them grow and
mature. Then, when the time was right, we would watch how our
children would bring friendship, understanding, and community to
all around them. My friends are gone, all that are left are my
children.&quot; 

Angus check with his spirit senses, and tried to recall some of
the stories of old he still knew from Scotland. This wasn't a
whisky spirit. It was a spirit of companionship, left mad from
years of being alone, chained to bottles of whisky. The same
whisky that friends would drink when they meet, the same whisky
that would hear the laughter, revel in the stories, and feel the
fellowship of friends meeting over a glass of whisky. A sad
place to be, locked up beneath the decks of a shipwreck, many
many metres below the sea. 

&quot;You may have lost your old friends,&quot; Angus started to bargain
with the spirit, &quot;but you can gain new ones! You can again meet
your friends, and watch your children grow, and please all. I
can help you, I can offer you a way out! If you are willing to
leave this world, and go back to the spirit world, I will give
you new friends, new... ''companions''. Enter one of these
bottles, and I will see to it that we, me and a group of my
friends, savour it. We shall meet, and share laughter, joys, and
stories while we venerate your children. What say you?&quot; 

== Companionship == 

Angus cherished the two bottles he got from the wreck's haul. It
would be a damn shame to open them, he thought. Whisky, probably
well over one hundred years old! Still, he knew the bargain he
had struck with the spirit had to be fulfilled, and in the end,
wasn't drinking the whisky the reason it had been distilled and
bottled in the first place? It would be grand to be able to
taste a mere drop of this whisky, and now he could share two
bottles with his friends. 

The pack had met at the [[Kaffeehaus Café]], all except
[[Grigor]]. The Rahu had decided against this meeting, as the police
would be there as well. Just as well, Angus thought, as it
needed to be an amicable meeting of friends to please the
spirit. He wasn't sure what his packmate, chronically short on
Harmony and oozing Father Wolf from every pore, would do to the
group here. He would still keep some of the whisky for the two
of them to drink privately. And not only because the unspoken
camaraderie of the two would please the spirit. You care for
your friends, Angus thought. And Grigor certainly would care for
some drinks and perhaps even a little company with him, the
alpha knew.

They all sat in a quiet corner of the café: [[Grigori]],
[[Alexandr]], [[Edouard]], and Angus himself; as well as Nievo
and two other policemen from the district. Nievo handed one of
the bottles to Angus, who carefully took it and opened it. He
took a sniff at the bottle, and immediately smelled the rich
flavours of the whisky. Smiling, he poured glasses for
them. Everyone was already trying to hold their anticipation in
check. &quot;If this is really an 18th century or early 19th century
whisky,&quot; Angus noted to the group as he handed out the glasses,
&quot;it will taste very different from present-day whiskies as you
might know them. I have read that it will be much smokier, much
heavier as well. A lot more peat was then used in the drying of
the barley. We shall see, won't we?&quot;  His eyes moved along the
table. &quot;Slainte!&quot;

[[Category:Tales]]

Danil Vasiliev took a deep breath and opened the door to the
youth centre. If his contact were to be believed, he might find
what he was looking for here, in the south of Admiralitetsky
District. A steady stream of adolescent playground voices 
assaulted his ears.
The warm hubbub was a welcome change from the
December chill, at least. As he stepped inside, 
a few of the youths glanced up from
their games and joking (and possibly more dubious pursuits), but
most ignored the fresh-faced newcomer. He shook off his woolly hat
and coat and found somewhere to deposit them.

As he was still getting his bearings, an unassuming young woman
came over with a smile. ''&quot;Hi, I'm guessing you're new here?&quot;''
She extended her hand. ''&quot;Anna.&quot;'' He smiled back.
''&quot;Hi, Anna, pleased to meet you. Yeah, it's my first time here. My name's Petr.&quot;'' He shook her hand. She seemed friendly
enough. ''&quot;Oh, OK. Hi, Petr. Do you want me to show you around?&quot;''

As Anna took him on a brief tour of the premises, Danil explained
his story. He told her that he was trying to set up a self-defence
youth project in a poor district off in the eastern suburbs of
Petersburg. He gave her a brief, practised speech outlining his
motivation and goals.
As if to prove all this, he fished out a folded sheet of paper
with a brief description of the project proposal, submitted
under the name &quot;Petr Bogdanovitch&quot;, with a stamp of approval from
the local council. She gave it only the briefest of glances.
''&quot;Yeah, I'm sure it's all in order.&quot;''

''&quot;So, you have some guy here who does some kind of self-defence course, is that right?&quot;'' 
''&quot;Oh, you mean Grigor, I suppose.&quot;'' She suddenly seemed a bit
less enthusiastic.

He pressed a bit further. ''&quot;So what exactly does he do?&quot;''
''&quot;Well, Grigor just does Grigor's thing, I guess. The whatever-it-is through self-defence, or boxing, or whatever. Some of the boys seem to like it.&quot;'' She shrugged. ''&quot;I dunno, I don't talk to him much.&quot;''
''&quot;Uh huh...&quot;'' Danil tried to sound noncomittal.
He added eventually: ''&quot;Well, can I meet him?&quot;''
''&quot;Sure, I guess,&quot;'' she responded, ''&quot;he must be around here somewhere...&quot;'' She glanced momentarily around the crowded room...

''&quot;Oh, there he is!&quot;'' Anna exclaimed. And there he was, the
slightly sinister-looking man, standing in a shadowy corner of the
room, staring directly at him. His head and face seemed to be about
equally shaven, and he wore a black T-shirt with a picture of a
giant red fist on it. He wasn't huge, by any means, but there were
some muscles there alright.
The man seemed to somehow have a rather strange presence about him.
Danil wasn't sure how long he had been watching him, which was even
more unnerving.

As he came closer, Danil thought he recognised him... A couple of
years older, shorter hair... but, yes, it could definitely be the
same face from the photograph.
The slightly offputting smell of... cigarettes? suddenly hit him.
Danil tried to hide his nerves and extended his hand with a
confident smile. ''&quot;Hi, I'm Petr.&quot;'' The boxer nodded and
gave his hand the briefest of squeezes. ''&quot;Alright. Grigor.&quot;''

---

Sure enough, Petr turned up again next week, on the dot.
Suspiciously punctual, in fact...
The newcomer hadn't spotted him yet, so Grigor took the opportunity
to eye him up further.
He certainly didn't look like much of a boxer, or any kind of
physical trainer, for that matter. He looked as if he was barely twenty, and
he had turned up suddenly out of the blue from god-knows-where in
eastern Petersburg trying to learn about his course. Who ''was''
this guy?

The newcomer spotted Grigor and came over. ''&quot;Evening! Well, I came.&quot;''
He seemed a little nervous. ''&quot;Thanks again, for agreeing to show me your course.&quot;'' Grigor nodded. Petr made a bit of small talk,
concerning the weather, rumours in the newspaper, the usual. And then
he asked, ''&quot;So tell me, when you're not here with the lads in the evening, what do you do with your time? Your day job, I mean.&quot;''

Again with the questions. Asking too many questions was a dangerous
business, especially in the Mafia -- it always looks suspicious.
Early on, a wiseguy had told the young Grigor never to ask
questions about things you don't need to know about, and he had
taken the advice to heart. Curiousity killed the cat, so they say.
There was definitely something not right here...

''&quot;Uh, I work construction part-time,&quot;'' he answered, ''&quot;on the new Baltika supermarket in Admiralitetsky at the moment.&quot;''
In fact he did have an employment contract for that building site
on his person, courtesy of his superior Vladimir. Not that he had
ever turned up to the place for work, though...

''&quot;So, let me show you the ropes, so to speak.&quot;'' Grigor said. He
quickly gathered up the boys and led the way down to the basement.
He stopped the first lad. ''&quot;Get your shoes off first. I've been told to watch out for the floor.&quot;'' The boy, chewing gum, grinned,
''&quot;You're jokin', right boss? You don't have to do what they say.&quot;''
Grigor didn't seem to be in a joking mood, though. ''&quot;Shoes off!&quot;''
he barked. The boys quickly complied. Seeing Grigor also switch
to bare feet, Petr also shucked off his trainers. They went downstairs,
where Grigor had set up a simple boxing ring of sorts. Grigor clapped
his hands together and the boys quietened down. ''&quot;OK, today, we're, uh... today, we're going to do a bit of barefoot and barefist fighting. Yeah.&quot;''

Petr stuck his hands in his pockets and stood next to Grigor. For
a quarter of an hour, the two watched as the boys began to take
turns in the ring. It seemed to be pretty serious stuff -- some of
the boys were dealing out some hefty bruises -- but Grigor didn't seem
to mind or admonish them. If anything, he encouraged it.
Petr leaned into his ear.
''&quot;Do you, uh, have a license for this?&quot;'' he whispered.
Grigor glanced at him and laughed shortly. ''&quot;You're kidding me, right?&quot;''
Danil let the subject drop. He had potentially more
serious crimes to consider...
''&quot;Here, keep an eye on them for a minute,&quot;'' the Rahu added,
''&quot;I've got to take a piss.&quot;''

Upstairs, Grigor found himself alone in the hall with the shoes.
He leant down and surreptitiously withdrew a small vial from his
underpants. Unscrewing the cap, inside was a small brush and a
sticky, opaque liquid. He quickly grabbed Petr's shoes and
brushed a liberal amount of the liquid on to the soles, getting
it between the treads. With his handkerchief, he wiped off the
excess stickiness from where the soles were worn, and put them
back in place.
He had gotten the specification from Grigori, when he had mentioned
his vague plan to his packmate. It was supposed to be dog pheromones, near
odourless to humans, but very smelly to canines. Supposedly. One of Aleksandr's
dodgy contacts had managed to source it for him at short notice.
''&quot;OK, bitch,&quot;'' Grigor muttered under his breath, ''&quot;now it's me sniffing around after you.&quot;''

---

Later that night, much later, the youth centre had shut and the
south Admiralitetsky streets were frozen, dark, and silent,
apart from the distant rumbling of the steelworks, which never
seemed to rest. Urhan-Grigor emerged from the shadows and sniffed
around near the entrance to the building. It was quite a distinct,
pungent smell, and he picked it up without difficulty. It led
away along the pavement, heading back to the centre of Shadowclaws
territory. It seemed that Petr had walked home, as he had hoped.

After a quarter of an hour or so, the trail had led into one of
the middling housing districts. The scent was becoming increasingly
faint -- the freezing air didn't help -- and he had had to double
back a couple of times. Sneaking furtively along the streets in the
dark from shadow to shadow, Grigor eventually found the end of the
trail before the door to an apartment building. The Rahu made a
mental note of the address. He didn't bother to change form before
heading home -- fuck it, it's too cold, he thought, and Urhan is faster anyway.

---

Next morning, around 10 am, the Rahu strolled back along the same
street. He &quot;accidentally&quot; dropped his cigarette lighter near to the
doorway. Leaning down, he pulled up his scarf over his nose, which
he shifted to an Urhan nose. It seemed there was a fresher scent,
but it wasn't easy to tell... He hurried on up the street, and at
the next junction, bent down to re-tie his shoelaces. The scent
was there, barely...

After ten minutes or so of walking, interspersed with clumsy
dropping and shoelace-tying incidents, the trail had led into
a quieter area consisting mostly of light industrial units and
a few mostly condemned housing blocks, in newly-gained
Shadowclaws territory. On instinct, Grigor pulled
himself back before the next junction, his pulse beginning to
quicken. Instead of taking the pavement, he glanced around quickly
before slipping over a low wall into an abandoned yard running
parallel to the next street. Finding a quiet spot, he switched to
Urhan form and slipped along through the undergrowth behind the
street.

There seemed to be figure standing alone on the next street
corner, blowing his hands against the cold. Grigor recognised
the shoes; it was Petr, all right. As he nudged forward under
cover, striving to get a better vantage point, a car idled
up to the street corner: a bog-standard police Lada. It pulled
up and two police officers, one man and one woman, both quite
young, got out. They shook Petr's hand. 
''&quot;Hey, Danil, what's up?&quot;'' asked the policeman, ''&quot;I thought this was supposed to be your day off!&quot;''

Mother-fucker -- a stone-cold cop! In fact, now that he thought
about it, they were only two blocks away from the local police
headquarters. Sloppy, sloppy, Grigor thought to himself. A wannabe
undercover cop. This guy is clearly no pro. And the life expectancy
for nosey cops in these parts... well, it wasn't too great. And if
he could do anything about it, the average would sink even further.

Grigor snuck forward a little so that he could eavesdrop...
''&quot;What's that?!&quot;'' Petr -- or Junior Officer Danil, as it seemed
his name was -- called out. The woman glanced in his direction, and he
pulled back, cursing silently. ''&quot;Hey, relax,&quot;'' she said to Danil,
''&quot;it's just a stray dog, or a fox.&quot;''

Danil, in plain clothes,
was pulling out a large black-and-white photo. Even from this
distance, Grigor could recognise his old file mugshot from his
Moscow days. ''&quot;Yeah, so this is him,&quot;'' Danil was saying, ''&quot;I'm positive. He spent two years in Moscow State for possession, suspected links to organised crime, it says on his file. And then his file finds its way to Petersburg, saying he's a person of interest related to all those fucked-up mass murders last year.&quot;''
He seemed to have attracted the interest of the others. He went
on, ''&quot;Funny thing is, his file is marked &quot;Investigation Concluded&quot;, although we don't seem to know dick all about him! Not even an address. Several parts have been redacted and I had to search quite a bit to dig him out...&quot;'' He adopted a conspiratorial tone.
''&quot;If I didn't know better, I'd say someone had buried the file.&quot;''

The uniformed guy frowned. ''&quot;So, he's a possible psycho mass murderer and/or Mafia muscle and, even worse, someone powerful could be protecting him, and you think it's a good idea trying to track him undercover?! You are fucking insane, dude.&quot;''

Grigor went cold -- even colder than he already was due to the frozen December air. He
licked his teeth and felt his muscles tense.
There was no-one else in the street! He could jump out of the
bushes and leap upon them in an instant. They wouldn't stand a
chance... He begun to ready himself to shift form...

Then, a second thought, or perhaps some remnant shard of wisdom:
Don't be an idiot! Grigor told himself. Three
dead cops in your new territory?! Yeah, that's exactly
what you need; Swims-under-Ice will be so pleased! And
with an old file photograph of dumb Grigor amongst the
mutilated bodies? Even better!
No, no, no. That won't do at all. Damn.

Gnawing his teeth, Urhan-Grigor retreated back into the shadows with a barely perceptible growl.
Still, he considered, he had the distinct advantage. He knew this
guy was on to him, but he didn't know he knew.
Forewarned is forearmed, Yelena had told him once. Now he
just needed a plan.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2923">There was this one positive thing about being an Uratha, Edouard thought one evening. Life never got boring.
The next ... let's call it morning, he was woken by the phone. The alarm clock read 5:14, way too early for his taste. He jumped up to answer it.
&quot;I told you to call me at my home at this hour. Use my cellphone if it is really urgent! Oh, entschuldigen Sie bitte. Ja, ich bin es am Apparat.&quot; and after listening to the caller for a while: &quot;Es hat bestimmt noch drei Stunden Zeit. Ich werde Sie vom Büro aus auf Ihre jetzige Nummer zurückrufen. Bis später.&quot;
And he went back to bed.

One week later, Edouard was negotiating witch Bombardier Aeronautical again. He didn't intent to ever show up there again, but it seemed that he was a bit more valuable to them than even he thought he was. It turned out that the I.T. department in Montreal botched the switch to the new document management system, and although they could recover most of the contracts, some bits were still missing. Being a person who doesn't pass on a good opportunity when it presents itself, Edouard readied himself for the kill. This time, his weapon would take the form of a telephone.

&quot;Edouard Lambert am Apparat. Verbinden Sie mich bitte mit Mr. Burns, er erwartet meinen Anruf.&quot;
:&quot;Ah, Edouard, haben Sie sich unser Angebot durch den Kopf gehen lassen?&quot;
&quot;Ich habe meinen momentanen Zeitplan bei Manatep durchgesehen, und ich kann es mir nicht leisten, jetzt meine Arbeitszeit für einen ehemaligen Arbeitgeber aufzubringen.&quot;
:&quot;Darüber lässt sich doch sicher verhandeln, und ich kann Ihnen versichern, dass wir Ihnen ein Angebot aus unseren Rücklagen für solche unvorhergesehenen Fälle machen können.&quot;
&quot;Ich sehe da in der Tat einen Ausweg. Fest steht, dass ich meinen Arbeitgeber nicht für einen ehemaligen Arbeitgeber vernachlässigen werde. Aber wie wäre es, wenn Sie nicht mein ehemaliger Arbeitgeber wären? Ich habe mal mit dem CEO von Manatep gesprochen, und wir können Bombardier für die Geschäfte in Russland günstige Konditionen Kredite bieten, sofern wir glauben, dass dort alles mit rechten Dingen zugeht. Was halten Sie davon, wenn jemand von Manatep, z.B. Edouard Lambert, sich am Aufsichtsrat von Bombardier Aernautical beteiligt? Davon haben wir alle etwas. Manatep kann sich sicher sein, dass Bombardier die Kredite auf jeden Fall zurückzahlen kann. Sie bekommen günstige Konditionen. Und ich kann mich mit gutem Gewissen voll und ganz um Ihr kleines Problem mit den Nachverhandlungen der verlorengegangenen Verträge kümmern.&quot;
:&quot;Das kann ich so jetzt nicht sofort beantworten. Ich werde Ihr Angebot mit den entsprechenden Stellen durchsprechen und mich dann wieder bei Ihnen melden.&quot;
&quot;Ich freue mich schon darauf.&quot;

And really, not four days later, his lawyer had the contracts ready and signed. Edouard was now officially in the board of directors at Bombardier.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1949">During my work, a quite interesting effect has transpired. I invented the spell 'Communion with the Forest' to aid in my investigations of the local fairy court, as well as in the search for Vis in the forest surrounding my humble laboratory building. During the first applications of this spell, nothing noteworthy seemed to happen. However, lately, as we were hunting for a werewolf creature close to a [[Hömberg|nearby village]], I caught a whiff of a strange odour in the air. Following the direction, I found a tree - but not just a regular tree! As my magically attuned senses quickly confirmed, the fruits of the tree were pure Vis. Sadly, it was of the rather useless animal form, but still it seems that my spell has more than the desired effect.

I suspect this incident - pleasant as it is - is due to the Vis Source present in my lab exerting some kind of influence on the design of the spell. This troubles me somewhat. Provided this influence occurs on a regular basis, how can I be sure that the spells will always have a benificial extra effect? Can I be sure that, for example, my most recent invention, the quite brilliant 'Feel the Unseen' (I should work on the name some more), does exactly what I want it to do - extend one's sense of touch to the room one resides in, that is - without painting pictures of the pope on the outside walls of the room? As I plan to create a number of further spells in my quest to settle the problem with the Fey once and for all, I should definitely spend further research on this particular phenomenon. The great library might have a book on that, and the tribunal will be soon, anyhow.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3583">====The Character====
A magus of House Tremere.

He obviously has a strange heritage: His skin does not reflect light as well as it should. While it's simply a bit darker than usual in daylight, it drops to almost utter black at night. While this appearance might be unsettling, Aphanius has a very smooth voice that has a strange but compelling sound. (His Faerie Blood grants +1 on rolls to influence people). Observers skilled in Faerie Lore find it likely that his heritage is that of nightly faeries, who whisper in the ears of sleepers to compel them to actions - a rather dark breed of fae.

Aphanius wears the traditional robes of House Tremere - in his case, they are coloured blue-black. He has not yet been spotted without them. A longsword is usually strapped to his belt, and his long black hair is well-kempt and usually held behind the head by a small tiara - [[Aphanius' Talisman]]. He wears a full beard, which has regrown in recent years since it was vandalized by Vexator at the Tribunal 1221.

Due to a Twilight Scar, ice does not melt on his person.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4200">A rather unpleasant event transpired lately, during the hunt on some devilish beast linked with Baron Schönfeld's bastard son, who continues to infest our rightful property on the rhine. As I attempted to spontaneously dispatch of the creature via an effect of the 'Perdo Vim' class, something went quite fundamentally wrong.

At first, I noticed only that the spell had failed, and that the magic resistance of my intended target was probably not responsible. However, as I started a repeated attempt, I could not help but notice that my magic did not seem to work. In fact, it seems I suppressed my own Gift. Thankfully, after some hours things went back to normal, but nonetheless this is a noteworthy event.

If I can - although accidentally and temporarily - suppress my own ability to use magic, should that not be a possible intended effect for a spell, with a hostile target? Can faeries be robbed of their weird powers without destroying them? That would probably not be against the code, if argued correctly. Anyhow, it warrants further investigation, once I find the time.

Well, it happened again. We have by now moved into our rightful property on the rhine island and started to lay the foundations for our covenant, Nummus Prosper. However, it seems our predecessor, who unfortunately managed to evade his untimely but justified death, has left us a surprise. Some dark beasts reside in a small grotto on the other side of the island, and they have attacked us.

Lacking an Aegis of the Hearth, we have to defend ourselves with the means at hand. Last night, one of the things made its way through the broken wall to the inside of the castle, and created a dark cloud hindering our grogs. In an attempt to remove the cloud with a spontaneous spell of the 'Perdo Vim' Class, I seem to have angered Lady Fortuna once more.

When the spell took effect, I quickly noticed that I had not only failed to remove the magical darkness, but also destroyed my own ability to see! It took about a day for my vision to return to normal. This is most unfortunate, and I start to really doubt that absolute control ist the best approach to Vim spells. I should write a treatise on this at some point.

This is most embarrassing. We finally have an Aegis of the Hearth - I developed the spell myself - and should therefore be warded against intrusions from the outside. However, the unpredictability of magic struck again, und while casting the Aegis on the Rhine island, a minor flaw crept into the ritual. It seems that now we are not warded against outsiders, but against ourselves.

A most unfortunate turn of events. Since I am not residing on the island, I am not adversely effected, still I feel that I have failed my responsibility as a Princeps most blatantly. While Undine seems to find a certain humour in the situation, Vexator is unterstandibly quite upset, and has taken it upon himself to cast any further Aegis spells on the island. As his magic seems to be quite structured - curse those thrice-damned faerie ancestors of mine! - I will of course agree to this.

I am also seriously considering options to atone for this embarrassing mishap. However, my resources are limited, so I can only offer covenant work for now, which should be a matter of course for a responsible princeps. I am therefore thinking of moving an amount of my personal Vis to the covenants stores.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2113">The Rhine island is ours, and we should start making profit from trade tariffs starting tomorrow.

After securing permission to reside on the island from the Baron - a mere formality, but the Quaesitores seem to value it - and agreeing upon the financial part of the rebuilding of the decaying castle, we set out to remove the last obstacle standing in the way of Nummus Prosper. It is amusing how easily the baron was swayed to our side once it became clear that his bastard son was involved in a plot to assassinate his daughter.

We set out at night, with two small boats, from the village on the bank of the river. Vexator and myself provided the magical muscle, shielded by Gunther and Hademar. After watching the castle for a small while from the safe shadows of the copse of trees on the northern end of the island, we decided on a plan of action. The mages would conceal themselves using my 'Shroud of Invisibility', and Vexator would levitate towards the castle and strike the guards down with a spell of the 'Perdo Corpus' class. As soon as things went wrong, the rest of us would simply storm the castle through a breach in the wall.

The plan was largely a success, though we should have left a guard on the docks. Vexator was able to remove two of the guards before his shadow was discovered. When the alarm was sounded, we stormed the castle, and quickly made our way up, the enemy standing no chance against the swords of our fighters and the Pilum of Flame. However, the useless bastard son had managed to use a rope to escape from his rooms, and was already in a boat rowing down the river when we noticed him.

Attempts to catch and kill him with bows and spells of 'Rego Corpus' and 'Perdo Corpus' class proved unsuccessfull. I fear that we might hear again from him, as he obviously had some minor magical powers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2586">It is unbelievable, and the fact that it is happening right in the center of Hermetic Tradition in the Rhine Tribunal only adds to the madness that is the events of the last days.

I am not yet a full magus, but soon shall be, although I have little hope of besting my beloved parens Clemens in the fine art of Certamen and outright winning my sigil. Considering this, it is amazing that I and a colleague, Friedrich of Schwaben, soon to be accepted into the House Tytalus, were sent out to look for a magus gone missing during a hunt in the forest surrounding the covenant. Still more amazing seems to be the utter and complete unawareness of most of the grogs and magi belonging to Durenmar of the fact that a magus, a member of the Order of Hermes, has gone missing in a faerie forest falling within their domain. I would dare to say many simply don't seem concerned.

Of course we were able to retrieve the missing person - from a fairy village, as suspected - but we required the help of the great Flambeau Philipus Niger, head of the Ash guild. That he had to be bothered is an unexcusable faux pas, yet we were mere apprentices and almost overwhelmed by the number of fairies attacking us. What should have happened is a defender of the covenant - do they even have that here? - or, failing that, the princeps itself, organizing a rescue party made of trustworthy grogs and then judging if personal involvement of a magus is required, as it turned out to be.

However, most of the magi here seem to be so taken by their studies that they probably would not even realize if the entire Army of the Holy Roman Emperor would pass by and consume the guards of their covenant in a three days orgy. Even worse, should one of the guards escape such a theoretical feast, it seems he would not bother to tell anyone, as the magi 'do not want to be disturbed in their research'. If anyone of these lowly humans would have been working at Fengheld, they would probably have been executed for incompetence. Yet the biggest covenant of the Tribunal does not seem to bother with organising their defenses, grogs, or just about anything. They do charge a fee of one pawn of Vis for attendance, though.

I will never tolerate such negligence in a covenant I am part of, and fully understand Archmage Stentorius' concerns and ideas to move the Tribunal elsewhere every second meeting.

An Ars Magica saga set in the [[Rhine Tribunal]].

The covenant of Nummus Prosper, officially formed in 1221 AD, has its main site on [[Pfalz Island]], on the River Rhine. There is a [[Waldheim|chapter house]] in the Westerwald Forest. The name of the covenant means &quot;lucky coin&quot;, a reference to the profitable toll-gathering business and to the [[Court of Dark Summer|lucky fairy gamble]] on the toss of a coin which (indirectly) led to the covenant's founding.

Here is a [[Nummus Prosper Timeline|timeline]] of events.

* Mushrooms growing under a magical tree -- now integrated into Aphanius' lab -- in Waldheim contain 2 pawns of Vim Vis per year (Autumn).
* The newly-discovered wolfberry tree in the Westerwald is a renewable source of Animal vis (Autumn).
* Sometimes vis can be found in the Westerwald in various forms (mushrooms, herbs, etc.).

* [[Court of Bright Winter]]
* ...

== House Rules ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4009">This is a rather unfortunate turn of events, and in the end we shall be lucky if we can walk away without a dent in the foreign relations of our covenant.

Apparently, the count of Nassau, upon whom's land the humble building containing my laboratory is erected - albeit, probably, without his knowledge - has seen fit to grant his nephew the right of founding a [[Hömberg|new settlement]] inside the unclaimed Westerwald. This came to our attention due to the apprehension of the sole hunter in the shabby village surrounding my home by said nephew's men. The accusation, as we soon discovered, is 'conspiring with the local wildlife against the village', or some such nonsense. I volunteered to escort the prisoner to the count, and was able to convince the Count's nephew to let me take him. Of course, I set him free, and notified my esteemed colleagues in the covenant by a cleverly disguised letter. I then proceeded to the count, where I tried to get some information about said nephew and a [[Victor|strange knight]] accompanying him. The knight was utterly unknown to the count, which confirmed my suspicions about him.

Our investigations were complicated by the harsh weather and the effect my esteemed colleague Relentus has on the lowly mundanes, but we quickly established that the village was plagued by wolves which had killed several villagers - a claim hotly disputed by members of the local Fay. Further investigations, especially some information gained by the spontaneous use of Intellego Vim magic by my humble self, nurtured our suspicion that lycanthropic creatures were involved. It did not take long for us to track one of them down and confirm these suspicions.

In the meantime, our main suspect turned out to be a [[Victor|member of the order]], a Mercere even, who had, on his way to deliver some news to us, stopped to help with the problems the village was facing. I can only hope that his severly misplaced bravado and naive approach will not cost him dearly one day, as he turned out to be a quite pleasant and helpful fellow.

Nonetheless, the problem of the village was, or is, not so much the problem faced by the villagers in the form of threat of consumption by the local wildlife, but rather the fact that the [[Court of Bright Winter|local fairy court]] considers this an intrusion and has - quite blatantly, as seems to be their way - stated that they want us to deal with this, provided we want to stay in their good graces. It is therefore the question which measures are to be taken. I do not oppose the wholesale slaughter of the village, however I fear that Undine's more gentle nature would be deeply disturbed by such a deed, and no magus should suffer for problems created by mere mortals. However, something needs to be done, and soon, as we want to return to our studies. Vexator Silvanum has found evidence that it is wiser to take actions and justify it afterwards, than to ask for permission and be denied. Our plan is now to ambush and kill the count's nephew outside the village, and then persuade the remaining peasants of the futility of their effort. As soon as the settlement is abandoned, the faeries can grow a new forest in its place in the span of a mere day, thereby concealing any trace of its former existence.

The only problem remaining right now is the church that has already been consecrated. Vexator is of the opinion that any destruction or desecration of the church not carried out by a catholic priest will invariably draw the attention of some kind of demon. However, we can not tolerate the existence of a dominion aura, however small, so close to our covenant. We shall see how this conflict can finally be resolved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2146">This time, I have certainly witnessed the events, and can create a full and true account.

While my esteemed colleague, [[Vexator]] Silvanum, still disputes my suspicions that his catatonic state after our first visit to the [[Wine Festival|Orgy on the Rhine island]] was due to his consumation of Muto Vis in the form of Wine during the festival, it is beyond doubt that the recent [[Notes on the measures taken against the disturbance of the fairy forest by the settlement attempt made by the nephew of the count of Nassau|werewolf plague]] in the newly founded [[Hömberg|village]] close to my humble laboratory is due to the consumption of Animal Vis by some of the lowly humans inhabiting said dwelling. 

We found that a tree, specified by members of the [[Court of Bright Winter|local fairy court]] to be a 'warding tree', growing Animal Vis, was responsible for the transformation of the lycanthropes. More specifically, the tree grew unusually large fruits, which contained the vis. Said members of the local Fay have claimed that this is some sort of self-defense mechanism by the forest, a response to the recent clearing of trees around the settlement. If so, it is certainly most noteworthy that such mechanisms exist and can be observed, as I also am some sort of intruder in this forest.

Still, I had not previously known that the mere consumption of Vis can transform you into a mindless beast. I am starting to guess that my esteemed colleague was somewhat lucky.

It occurs to me only now that some of the herbs that we found in the [[Ludold|village elder]]'s hut were Vis. They have of course been safely removed, but I wonder if not the strange alignment of the [[Torven|local hunter]] with the [[Court of Bright Winter|Fay]] might be the cause of treatment with such plants. This might warrant further investigation.

A fairy court in a regio in the Westerwald, not too far from [[Waldheim]]. It can be accessed during Winter, in the daytime. Upon traversing a snowy clearing, the way is blocked by two giant snowmen guardians. In order to pass, one must succeed at a challenge, a test of Wisdom, Endurance, or the Hunt. (Possibly beating the crap out of the snowmen would also work?) Beyond, a path leads up to the hilltop at the centre of the regio. Here, snowflakes drift gently around, and numerous fairy wolves and other lesser faeries may be found in repose. The ruler of the court, the Maid of Frozen Dew, is seated in a cave behind a pane of ice. She has the seeming of a beautiful maiden with a serene expression, dressed in a pale gown and wearing a coronet of ice.

The court appears to be seeking assistance in protecting the wolves from the Count of Nassau's huntsmen. They do not appear to welcome those who hunt in the forest, at least those who have not obtained permission.

In several ways, this court appears to be counterpart of the [[Court of Dark Summer]].</text>

Waldheim, which has a Magic aura of 2, is a tiny and isolated hamlet in the Westerwald, a large forest to the east of the Rhine valley. It can be reached in half a day's travel along forest paths from the village of Ems (which is on the River Lahn, about 5 miles upstream from the Rhine).

In the centre of the small clearing is an ancient oak tree, now partially enclosed by [[Aphanius]]' large pentagonal edifice, which completely dominates the place.
It is surrounded by a half-dozen huts, some ancient stone foundations, and the forest. A small stream runs by one side. The largest hut belongs to the hamlet &quot;elder&quot;, [[Ludold]], who is a gaunt middle-aged man with spiky white hair and has a habit of wearing odd things. Another hut belongs to his son, [[Torven]], a rugged young man dressed in leathers with a she-wolf companion, Red-Hame. In one set of the stone foundations dwell some seemingly tame(ish) wild pigs. In the other is a vegetable plot. They also have a bee tree. The hamlet has very little contact with the outside world, although they trade what surplus they have (e.g. pigs, honey) for grain, which is kept in a small barn. The various animals in the clearing don't seem particularly bothered by each other.

The covenant's grogs that live here dwell in a small barracks along the path just beyond the clearing. [[Relentus]]' large lab is hidden a couple of dozen paces behind the clearing.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2164">Pfalz, the island in the Rhine, which has a Magic aura of 2, is located in the Rhine Gorge roughly halfway between Mainz and Koblenz. It's about 120 yards to the left bank, and 80 yards to the right bank. The valley sides are quite steep-sided, making the river by far the most practical means of transport. The small town of Kaub is a couple of hundred yards downstream on the right bank. Above it, Burg Kaub has just started construction. The castle of Baron Schönburg and the town of Oberwesel is about 3 miles downstream on the left bank. Ships regularly pass by the island and are obliged to stop and pay a toll -- this is the covenant's main source of income, shared 50-50 with Baron Schönburg.

The island is a little less than 100 yards long, and the amount which is above water depends on the river level. The upstream half of the island shoulders the fortress, which is freshly rebuilt. It has an elongated hexagonal footprint. The central tower is also new, secretly created thanks to a casting of ''Conjuring the Mystic Tower''.
Immediately upstream of the island is Undine's underwater lab and ship-lab.
The side facing the left bank has some (partially) underwater rocks on which a small pier is built. The downstream half of the island has a tiny copse of trees. A vine grows on the central one.

A short distance upstream, and connected (when the water is low) by a rocky spine is the &quot;South Island&quot;, slightly larger, with more trees, and less flat. Somewhere in this island lurks something foul, Undine claims, or at least there is a bad-smelling underwater passage which she doesn't venture too far into...

A fairy court in a regio in the forest on the left bank of the Rhine, about a day's travel from [[Schönburg]]. It can be accessed during Summer, in the nighttime. Upon traversing a marshy clearing, the way is blocked by two giant pumpkinhead scarecrow guardians. In order to pass, one must succeed at a challenge, a test of Skill, Chance, or Arms (i.e. defeating the pumpkinheads). Beyond, a path leads down to the fiery glade at the centre of the regio. Here, tiny witchfires drift gently around, and brightly-coloured flowers spray fire into a pool. The ruler of the court, the Crone of the Brazier, sits before a giant brazier which she endlessly stirs. She seems to be an ancient woman. Another notable resident is the Dame of the Fountains of Flaming Flowers, an elegant but melancholy woman of indeterminate age.

The magi were searching for a cure to the ailment of Karlotte, the daughter of the Baron of Schönburg, and were trying to get the Crone to force the Dame to answer their questions. (It seems the Dame has some kind of knowledge of or link to the Schönburg family?) The magi refused the rather distasteful (to them, anyway) proposed deals, such as destroying a nearby monastery or capturing an unbaptised baby for the Crone. Instead, they wagered versus an unspecified favour on a coin toss... which they won!

In several ways, this court appears to be counterpart of the [[Court of Bright Winter]]. Anyone with a modicum of Faerie Lore (such as [[Aphanius]]) will have noted that the three most important faeries complete the classic trio of maid, mother, and crone.</text>

The Rhine Tribunal, as the site of the Order's Founding, is the oldest of the thirteen Tribunals covering Europe. As such, its magi like to call it the &quot;First Tribunal&quot;. Its territory broadly coincides with that of the Holy Roman Empire.

Among the numerous idiosyncracies and ancient traditions of the Tribunal are the three ranks assigned to magi: journeyman, master, and archmage. The latter two are granted one and two extra votes, respectively, by wielding the sigils of &quot;retired&quot; magi.

Here is a [[list of magi]] of the Tribunal.

== Gilds ==

Politics in the Rhine Tribunal largely revolves around the six political gilds, as follows:
* [[The Oak Gild]]
* [[The Elder Gild]]
* [[The Hawthorn Gild]]
* [[The Ash Gild]]
* [[The Linden Gild]]
* [[The Apple Gild]]

== Covenants ==

The covenants of the Rhine Tribunal are as follows:

* [[Durenmar]], domus magnus of House Bonisagus, and site of the Great Library and Tribunal and Grand Tribunal gatherings
* [[Crintera]], domus magnus of House Bjornaer
* [[Irencillia]], domus magnus of House Merinita
* [[Roznov]]
* [[Dankmar]]
* [[Fengheld]]
* [[Triamore]]
* [[Turris Glorium]]
* [[Oculus Septentrionalis]]
* [[Waddenzee]]
* [[Nummus Prosper Saga|Nummus Prosper]]
* [[Heorot]] (subject to Grand Tribunal approval)</text>

Climbing the stairs, one arrives in the far end of the actual lab, facing the wall. Turning, the visitor will immediately see a large but demure throne. Usually, Vexator and his familiar fight who is allowed to sit on the throne; The cat has an identical, but much smaller throne on the side of the lab, but prefers the &quot;real&quot; throne. The lab is luxuriously and comfortably outfitted and only the finest materials for all items in the lab were used. A gallery spans the back half of the lab, so Vexator can easily follow all happenings in his lab. From the gallery, two gates lead outside to a balcony, allowing a magnificent and commanding view of the entire river (and, in good weather, an excellent range for Sight and Voice spells).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7071">The first part of construction work is finished, and the magi of Nummus Prosper can now finally live in conditions suitable for their status. The covenant is running smoothly, and with the central tower soon to be erected by a 'Creo Terram' class spell, I finally find the time to make some notes on how things work.

I will start with the hermetic positions.

The most important position in the covenant, that of a Princeps, is held by me. I am still a bit surprised by my good fortune at the last tribunal: While I would not have opposed the founding of a chapter house, the strict rejection of the idea by my esteemed colleague [[Vexator]] not only gave me a reason to justify the founding of an independent covenant before my Tremere superiours, but also the leverage to press for a charter of my liking and the position of Princeps - though it seems that my esteemed colleague Vexator and I are of more or less the same oppinion about running a covenant.

I did not yet have much work to do in my role as princeps, as things are only slowly settling into place. No major threat has occured yet, and the few difficulties we faced were easily overcome by a joint effort. I am looking forward to the next tribunal meeting, where we will no longer be running around trying to please everyone, but represent an independent covenant.

My esteemed colleague Vexator has taken upon himself the position of Librarian, and seems to be doing a good job of it. The unnatural urge for conflict, which seems to be the defining trait of Tytali magi, has not interfered with our aquistion of books so far. Though sometimes tiring, I consider the fact that most Tytali - and my esteemed colleague Vexator certainly included - are quite capable of standing and fending for themselves a fair trade for their confrontation-happy nature. He would have made a good defender too, I guess.

The position of Defender is, unfortunately, not occupied at the moment. We have only two more magi in the covenant, and since the charter forbids occupying more than one hermetic position, it seems that one of my esteemed colleagues [[Undine]] or [[Relentus]] will have to take up that position. While Undine seems to have a way with the lowly mortals, I doubt that her cheerfull and soft nature makes for a good Defender. Relentus on the other hand seems to be very concentrated on his lab work - as most of the Verditius magi - and I do not want a Defender wo does not recognize the importance of his position. I hope this can be resolved in the future, as I fear we might need a Defender sooner than we would like, given the history of the Rhine Gorge.

Thus are the hermetic positions of the covenant. I will now follow up with the mundane positions, of which we have two.

Albrecht, the gifted treasurer that has accompanied me from Fengheld, has been appointed to the position of Autocrator, overseeing all the non-martial mundane matters of the covenant. His reports are somewhat less structured than could be expected, but the calculations seem to be right, and his administrative talent is no doubt a great contribution to the increasing mundane wealth of our covenant. He has recently taken on an apprentice, the young physician Heinrich of Cologne, and started training him in the art of stewardship.

Hademar, a man from the Alps Tribunal, has been appointed to the position of Guard captain, overseeing all the martial mundane matters of the covenant. He is truly a legendary fighter, even surpassing my shield grog, Gunther, in fighting prowess. Unlike Gunther, though, he seems to have a bit more of intellect, and a good grip on the grogs. He has been essential in securing our tariffs, and is a valuable companion for more dangerous travels. I consider it a true blessing that he has found his way here.

Given the good job most of our covenant officials are doing, it should be expected that our covenant is doing well - which it is. It is also understandable that I am quite hesitant about appointing someone Defender whom I do not entrust with the powerful position.

At my explicit request, we have reserved the right of the Princeps to call upon members of the covenant to take up the position of delegate, either to the Fay, the church, or the nobility. 

I will in due time appoint myself as the fairy delegate, of course, since this was part of the whole idea of delegate and will be a perfect way to combine my research with working towards the good of the covenant.
Note: As of late, with [[Notes on the measures taken against the disturbance of the fairy forest by the settlement attempt made by the nephew of the count of Nassau|the arrival of Count Nassau's Sohn]], this is more pressing, and I shall declare my own appointment at the next Winter Solace.

As my esteemed colleague Undine seems to have a way with mortals, I am considering appointing her the nobility delegate, should the need arise. Her physical beauty should be a boon to such a position, as mundanes usually easily fall for that.
Note: Again, with the founding of Hömberg and the actions we have to take against it, this is more pressing. I shall write Undine and ask her if she would accept her appointment. We need to stay on good terms with the nobles that, according to their own useless laws, own the land we live on.

The church delegate is, luckily, not necessary at this time, so I have no plans right now for a future appointment - though if the need arises, I shall probably appoint either myself, due to my experiences with the church, or Undine, especially if she does a good job keeping the nobles happy.

Lastly, our charter requires the incubents of official positions to name a deputy, something we have not yet done. I am assuming that Albrecht will name his apprentice, Heinrich, as his deputy. As to myself, the choice is a bit more difficult.

My esteemed colleague Vexator is already holding an official position, and would have to lay down his own one if he would have to take up his duties as a deputy. Naming him would not really be compatible to the whole idea of deputies, and as much as I value his contributions to the covenant so far, I am a bit hesitant to appoint a Tytalus to such a powerful postions, given their conflict-seeking nature. So that option is off the table.

My esteemed colleague Undine is, I think, simply not made for the job, lacking the decisiveness and emotional detachment required, while my esteemed colleague Relentus can, I guess, simply not be bothered. Still, Relentus is the best candidate right now, simply by the merit of being the lesser evil.
Note: As of late, Relentus seems to show a bit more interest in a smoothly running covenant, so I think he is the most natural candidate for now. Should the question of Deputies come up, I will appoint him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3295">I have decided where to erect my laboratory, and am now supervising the construction of the building. I went for a defensive structure, should the relations with the [[Court of Bright Winter|local fairy court]] go sour.

The place of my choosing is a small hamlet about half a day's worth of travel from nearest civilisation, in the forest of Westerwald. It consists of a handful of shabby huts housing about a dozen people. The locals seem to survive on hunting, growing a few vegetables in the village - and herding animals that strangely do not seem to need a fence. Initial investigations using spells of the 'Intellego Vim' class were not successfull, but I shall surely resume my attempts on a later date.

The choice was a difficult one to make. One one hand, I am very close to a fairy court, so my research should be easier to carry out. At least one of the local villagers even seems to have a kind of connection to the Fay, a matter that I will investigate at some future point. I will try to get the confidence of said court, as far as this is possible, to ease my future research. I do not, however, expect results before the next tribunal meeting. The matter is a delicate one, given the nature of Fay, and I will not spoil things with ill-advised haste.

There is also a Vim Vis source here, at the base of a mysterious tree which I suspect to be a central part of the local aura. I have decided to construct my lab around it, in the hope that it will further my research. The tree resisted initial investigation, but I will certainly resume it at a later point.

A disadvantage is the physical distance to the covenant itself, which does not help with my duties as Princeps. Though we agreed to install a magic door permitting instant travel between the covenant and the grog building located near the village, my esteemed colleague [[Relentus]] has told me that it will be some time before this might actually happen, since it requires a level of skill (and an amount of Vis) that currently is not present in the covenant. Until then, we shall have to rely on mundane means of communication and travel - except for my esteemed colleague [[Vexator]], who has a 'Rego Corpus' Class spell for the purpose of moving greater distances - a fact that I quite regret.

This means that there will be at least a day between an event transpiring on the [[Pfalz Island]] and my arrival, after notification. As I am not aware that we have yet declared a 'Defender of the Covenant', I will definitely have to ask a magus on the island to take up that post. However, my esteemed colleague Vexator is already charged with the burden of Librarian, and though he took it voluntarily, I do not think that it would be in the spirit of our covenant if he took up an additional duty. The only remaining member of the Order on the island is my esteemed colleague [[Undine]], but I do not yet know her enough to trust her with such a position. I hope that she will prove worthy, so this problem can be taken care of.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3753">==Founding a Covenant==

Oh well, my Gauntlet is passed and I can finally leave that blasted place of [[Irencilla]] for good. I met two other Sodalis, freshly gauntleted: [[Aphanius]] and [[Relentus]]. Relentus is a likeable chap. He doesn't talk much and is content with him being a Verditius lab rat in our covenant-elect. No muss, no fuss. Aphanius is a special case. He is from [[Fengheld]], and over-eager, as all younger Tremere are bound to end up with, after their terrible apprenticeship. I seriously do not know how they can survive such a gruesome trial. Aphanius started fussing about opening a chapter house, rather than a covenant. Has he gone mad? And spend my next 50 years copying some dusty tomes for some haggard old Tremere magus? Nevertheless, I was quickly able to get this idea out of his mind with a very favourable deal. We will found a proper covenant, and he will in turn become Princeps. What a wonderful deal! How in their right mind wants to become Princeps anyway? Only work, no benefits. I feel that I can channel the over-eager Tremere tendencies of young Aphanius to my liking by allowing him to become Princeps. Then, he will be overly concerned with the good of the covenant. It should be possible to persuade him to see my own good as the good of the covenant. 

==Location of the Covenant==

We have visited the sites of three of the four former covenants in the Rhine Gorge valley. Of these, only one comes to mind when thinking of a proper covenant. My eye is set on Pfalz island, a small ruinish castle directly on an island in the Rhine river. Once we rebuild the castle there is plenty space for grogs and labs. And, we can build a tower, in the top level of which I can build my lab -- a proper, regal surrounding. We can collect tolls from this castle with ease. Quick calculations made by [[Albrecht]] led us to assume that we can collect a small fortune this way -- more than a typical covenant can command in riches! 

Relentus, in particular, seems keen on establishing the covenant on the second site: a small hamlet (actually a collection of three huts) in the Westerwald. The advantage is that the covenant would be far off from any civilisation and interferings. The disadvantage is exactly the same. 

We have decided and the result is even better than I could imagine: we will build the covenant on Pfalz island and a chapter house in the Westerwald. Aphanius and Relentus are keen to go off into the woods, I personally will stay on the island, with Undine as company. This suits me perfectly: the overzealous Aphanius will leave me alone for most things, Relentus will stay locked in his lab and cannot bother the mundanes on my island. I will erect a Mystic Tower and occupy the top two levels with my lab and living quarters. Undine wants to build her lab ''underwater''! For crying out loud! Well, at least she will also not bother me and I am the undisputed master of the island. 

==Official Positions==

Aphanius claimed the title of Princeps, and I gladly (but feigning reluctance) obliged. With him sitting in the Westerwald, a good half-day travel from Pfalz island, and Undine underwater most of the time, all Hermetic visitors first come to me. This gives me the power of a Princeps, without the nuisance. Any visitors deemed uninteresting by me are sent to the chapter house. 

As a &quot;price&quot; to give up my Princeps ambitions, I claim the title of Librarian. This way, I can keep track of what my sodalis are studying and can make good estimations of their hermetic capabilities. Better still, I can subtly influence the acquisitions of new books and resources. Meaning, my own pet fields will be expanded far more often. I expect to see many Rego tractati coming in!

This is going to be a lenghty article, since it will follow my main line of work. However, for now, it is merely a compilation of rough ideas yet to be formed, and an outline of the work that I have laid out before me.

====State of affairs====
Soon, there will be the first tribunal since the founding of the covenant, and by then all of our debts will be cleared. When we have established ourselves in the Rhine Tribunal, and survived the critical first seven years, I can rest somewhat more easily. While I will still be devoted to keep the covenant running smoothly - what is a man that forgoes discipline and duty? - I expect to be able to set aside more time for my own, personal research.

Since the tribunal is also a great opportunity for meeting fellow magi and exchanging research, I want to organize the research I expect to carry out ahead of the tribunal. It would be a sad and unnecessary thing if I were to find out I missed something merely because I did not think of it.

====Basic Theory====
I will refer to the work of the Great Flambeau Archmage Philipus Niger and his approach to the final solution of problems, which is basically split into three parts:

:1. Find the source(s) of the problem.
:2. Eliminate the source(s) of the problem.
:3. Eliminate all symptoms of the problem left.

While I am certain that I will not see the second part accomplished in the time I am given on this earth, and suspect that I may not even live to see the first through, I am nonetheless determined to make as much progress on the first part as possible, and deduce ways to tackle the second part.

This leads to the next question, which is: How does one determine the source(s) of the problem? Here, common opinion in hermetic theory is that a problem is characterized by its symptoms, and if one follows the symptoms to their origin, one will arrive at the source of the problem. I will therefore shortly lay out the symptoms, which are in these case the problems themselves, in rough terms:

The main problem - one could even say, the real problem - would be the interference these creatures present, which can be roughly split into two parts: Most importantly, the interference with hermetic society, and on a side note, the interference with mundane society, which is only mentioned here since we are bound by the Hermetic Oath to respect the mundanes and not upset them, implying that their problems are at least in a certain way our owns.

The problems created by the Fay for hermetic society are manifold, but usually boil down to a few things: The general threat they can present to travelers, their interference with the rightful access to magical resources and the existence of fairie auras were magical auras could percievably be.

The problems for mundane society basically boil down to the threat they pose, which only concerns travelers - and who cares if a few worthless mortals go missing? - and their tendency to 'claim' children as their own, which leads to fairie bastards as my unlucky self. I jugde these problems to be far more basically than the ones presented for hermetic society, especially since the first one - the threat to travelers - is probably not worth solving at all. I will therefore focus on the second problem, which is the existence of creatures that have 'mixed' blood, as my first main work. It will provide a good basis for later work, and serve as a valuable exercise. I do not expect it to take more than two tribunal periods.

It is interesting to note that only few of the fairy bastards are actual offspring of a direct breeding between fay and human. While some seem to stem from the fairies' fondness of abducting children at young age and keeping them with them for a while, others seem to appear at random in a family where noone can remember any contact with the Fay. They all have a certain attunement to the fairies in common, be it the aptness at handiwork of those with dwarven ancestry or my very own, much more worrysome, heritage.

====First Act: On the presence of Fay in persons====
I therefore deduce that some part of the fairie bastards is indeed attuned to the realm of fairy. My first quest will be to determine how exactly this attunement manifests. I am assuming that spells of the 'Intellego Vim' class will be of the greatest help in this, and have chosen my studies of the recent years accordingly. For the future, I plan to secure - preferably live - specimen and conduct some basic experiments. While the sole hunter at Waldheim seems to be attuned to the realm of Fay, I hesitate to choose him as my first object of study, as I cannot guarantee for the health of the subject, and he seems to be a valuable contribution to the running of the Waldheim Chapter House. It should prove easy enough to find another, more disposable, subject.

====Second Act: Establishing a defense====
I have determined that Waldheim cannot be at the whim of the local Faerie courts. If things come to blows, it is better to be prepared. If not, it is better to negotiate from a position of power than from one of weakness. I have therefor decided to collect tools for the use in dire situations. Careful planning is one of the key factors of winning a battle.

My first step shall be a visit to the court of bright winter, to gain an arcane connection to their ruler and assess their defenses a second time. The recent development of the Hömberg problem has provided me a suitable basis to demand such a connection as a form of 'payment'. I will set out as soon as I fully recovered from my wounds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2261">I passed my gauntlet last night, and finally am a full member of the Order of Hermes. Though I am certainly going to miss my esteemed colleague Master Clemens, my parens, after leaving [[Fengheld]], I nonetheless look forward to the future. With my initiaion to the order soon to be officially carried out at the Tribunal meeting in Durenmar, I will be able to start on the work I have set out for my life. It is not a small thing, but I am sure that I will be able to at least make a significant contribution towards a final solution to the fairie problem.

I am going to arrive in Durenmar a few weeks earlier than the Tribunal meeting, to complete my gild training. I was delighted to hear that my Tutor will be no one else but the famous Archmage Philipus Niger of Flambeau. It is an extreme honour to be taught by one of the greatest Magi of the Tribunal, and I do not hesitate to admit that he is one of my personal idols due to his ways of dealing with the Fay.

The Ash guild is mainly concerned with seeing magi returned to the status that is rightfully theirs. As we are, figurally speaking, gods among flies, it is quite antagonizing to realise that the flies seem to be those in control, and our own laws forbid us from correcting this. The hermetic magi have taken the utterly wrong approach of hiding out from mundanes, for fear of - whatever. I do not understand how the mundanes should be able to oppose a concerted effort of hermetic magi in any way. They are so easily brought to one's own side, dominated, or simply disposed of, that they should be happy for the leadership of responsible magi. Yet the founders of the order seem to have believed that some corrupted clergy, kings, and the likes of them make for more suitable leaders.

I sincerely hope that, whereever I will find myself in a year, I will be able to help the Ash guild enforce its policy. My own research is dedicated to it, though not in correspondence to the mundane, but to the Fay - for personal reasons, if nothing else.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2138">Due to the peculiarities of the Rhine Tribunal's Peripheral Code, a master will always win over a journeyman in a dispute. This means, any run-of-the-mill Ex Misc riff-raff master can claim the fruits of my own labour and get away with it! And there is absolutely nothing I could do. This, of course, cannot do. I therefore wish to attain the rank of a master as soon as convenient. No, definitely earlier than that. 

To achieve the rank of a master, I need three other master of this Tribunal. These will grant me a token, signalling that they would acept me as a master in their midst. Once I have gathered three tokens, I may claim the rank of master. [[Aphanius]] keeps on insisting that I also need to be known in the Tribunal for my magical prowess. This may be a binding restriction for him, but surely not for me. A man of my statue, a pillar in the scientific community will have no problems to be recognised by his peers. 

==Achieving master rank== 

These three masters granting the tokens may not be either of my House or of my covenant and should be of different guilds. A sensible system, designed to stop upstart Houses such as the Tremere. I have my eyes set on three masters: 

* Henri de Tours. A Jerbiton master of the Apple guild. He is a likeable chap. We already are in letter contact and exchange business prospects, books and ideas. I think there will be no difficulty in obtaining his token. 
* A master of the Ash guild. I still have not decided whom to ask, but a Flambeau aggressive magus would probably be my best bet. I might be able to offer some Hoplite work as &quot;payment&quot; for the token. There should be a suitable aggressive Flambeau somewhere... I also have the bargaining chip of the Demon-warding item that we secured. I also wish to impress the Ash guild with my invention of the spell ''It's raining men''. 
* A third master of either the Linden, or possibly the Oak guild. Occultes from Durenmar seemed friendly enough. 

Additionally, I have trained a [[On his familiar|familiar]]. I was let to believe that this would make me look more competent and deserving of a master title.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4207">I have been told that having a familiar is beneficial for my quest to achieve [[On achieving the title of Magister|masterhood]]. There is a peculiar cat on my island that has piqued my interest. It is a black cat that seems to be magical: at times, one can see it, then it vanishes from plain sight. A teleporting cat, maybe? If so, it would compliment my magics perfectly! 

The cat is generally nosy and walks around the island as if it owns this piece of land. I have by now tried several times to befriend the cat, but it is very leery of me (or, indeed, any person). With the casting of our Mystic Tower, and my completion of my lab in the tower, I have succeeded in taking the cat up to the tower with me. It seems to like the lab rooms and the commanding view from the balcony. 

I now firmly believe that the cat is suitable as my familiar. Over the months, we have grown to like each other. I now wish to pose a final test on him, before I will try to bind him as my familiar. I took the cat with me to the village Kaub. Entering the church, I wish to find out if the cat is in any way infernally tainted -- one cannot be too careful with this! The cat entered the church without problems, and I could also approach the altar with him. The cat jumped off my arms and hid in the church, but after some looking, I found him hiding behind one of the aisles. 

Satisfied, I proceeded with the binding of the familiar rites. My powerful command of Rego and Corpus magics are enough to bind a second-magnitude Gold and Bronze Cord, and also a first-magnitude Silver Cord. The cat has willingly entered the familiar bond and is now officially my familiar. I have made sure that the covenfolk know of this, and show the necessary respect towards him. I think he likes this... he is now often in my lab, sitting on ''my'' throne, even though I have ordered a replica throne in cat-size for him. I guess I am too soft on him. 

I still do not have a name for my familiar, so for now I call him ''Felis'' -- Cat. I reason that he must already have a name of his own devising, and I will ask him that name once we can communicate clearly. I need to research some Mentem magics, so that we can share thoughts and words through our familiar bond and that he can parley his name. 

I also need to find a way to make him speak the human tongue. Once I am able to do enchant both effects, I can send the cat in lieu of myself to the covenant meetings, let him relay the meeting procedures via our mental bond, and let him talk at the meetings to communicate my orders and wishes. I can't wait to see the faces of my sodalis once this happens! 

== Stats ==

These are the basic stats of a magical cat, as per RoP:M, Andrew. Needs 2 Flaws to balance the Virtues, plus can have 13 points of Qualities (which can also be virtues). RoP:M is totally broken, so feel free to adjust as needed. :) Has no Powers yet.

Vexator is trying to turn her into a spy/diplomat, stressing individual and independent thinking (this is in stark contrast to the demands [[Aphanius]] makes of [[Günther|his shieldgrog]]), covert operations, and even ordering her to learn to read and write. The other magi think this is folly, and Jacqueline is often overwhelmed and at loss as to what is expected from her. 

Jacqueline is especially &quot;fond&quot; of [[Aphanius]] since his genius joke about her recently deceased colleague. (He was beheaded by some beast, whereupon Aphanius remarked: &quot;Yes, you have to be careful with magic. It's very complex and you might well lose your head.&quot;)

See also the [[seasonal activities]] for each magus.

== 1220 ==

* Winter: The apprentices arrive at Durenmar and receive their gild training. [[Aphanius]] completes his Gauntlet (certamen). Aphanius and [[Vexator]] are sent to recover a Jerbiton magus (Timotheus) lost on a hunt in the Black Forest; they are successful, of course. This was somehow part of Vexator's Gauntlet?
* Spring: Swearing of the Oath at the spring equinox in the Forum of Hermes and official admittance into the Order of Hermes. Greeting by [[Murion]], the prima of House Bonisagus. The new magi, together with a certain [[Relentus]] from the Roman Tribunal, are sent to investigate the Rhine Gorge, which has been opened to Hermetic settlement after a number of covenants were destroyed in a series of unfortunate events (the latest involving the Archbishop of Cologne). They decide to establish a covenant there. However, they first spend a season writing books for the [[Great Library]]. (Aphanius was too wounded to travel)
* Summer: Arrival in the Rhine Gorge and investigation of possible covenant sites; decision to settle [[Pfalz Island]] and perhaps also the Westerwald; negotations with Baron Schönburg result in a &lt;s&gt;hostile takeover&lt;/s&gt; [[Notes on the measures taken to remove the baron of Schönburg's bastard son from our rightful property|benign redistribution of property rights]] of the island occupied by his bastard son. During the rescue of [[Karlotte Schönburg]], the [[Court of Dark Summer]] is discovered; the healing of Karlotte is effected by winning a coin toss against the Crone of the court. Reconstruction starts. Evil undead creatures attack the covenant from the adjacent island to the south, a possible heritage of the previous owner. Vis is discovered on the island, at the Schönburg, and in the Westerwald. Some toll-runners are thwarted.
* Autumn: Visit to the wine festival at Baccharach; source of vis discovered; Vexator has a &quot;bad trip&quot;.

== 1221 ==

* Spring: [[Tribunal of 1221]]; formal approval of the founding of Nummus Prosper; favours promised; gild meetings. [[Undine]] decides to join the covenant (this was the favour to Crintera).
* Summer: Aphanius travels to [[Waldheim]] to investigate it and settle there; meets [[Ludold]] and [[Torven]].

== 1222 ==

* Winter: Aphanius visits the [[Court of Bright Winter]].
* Spring: Arrangement with Baron Schönburg for the reconstruction of the tower.
* Summer: Hospitallers confiscate covenant property in Bonn, which is restored to its rightful owners (us).

== 1223 ==

* Summer: Aedh mac Cathal, a strange prince from far distant lands (Ireland) arrives; travel to Ireland via a Magic regio; participation in a faerie contest.

== 1224 ==

* Spring: Investigation of trouble in a nearby village and discovery of an Infernal reliquary, which Relentus repairs. Vexator travels to Frankfurt for a meeting at the summer solstice.

== 1225 ==

* Summer: Trip to Trier; discovery of the remains of Treverorum covenant and the body of Arliandus of House Tremere; new vis source discovered in the amphitheatre.

== 1226 ==

* Autumn: Disturbance of the faerie forest near Waldheim in a settlement attempt, [[The Removal of Hömberg|thwarted]] by the players. Discovery of a new vis source (warding tree).

== 1227 ==

* Spring: [[Tribunal of 1227]].

== 1228 ==

* Spring: The [[Grand Tribunal]] takes place at Durenmar

== 1229 ==

* Spring: An upstart Flambeau apprentice is recovered from infernal hedgies in Cologne as a favour to Philipus Niger.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9274">====Day 0: Starting to build the lab====

The building housing my future Laboratory has finally been completed. It took quite some time, but the resulting pentagonal edifice was well worth the wait. I will start moving into the Lab tomorrow, expecting the basic furnishing to be finished within the year. The tree fits very nicely, and having a source of Vim Vis in the Laboratory should be helpful in my studies.

We have convinced [[Relentus]] to build a number of magical lamps as covenant work. Therefore, illumination of the lab will be very good. I have heard [[Vexator]] talk about a so-called &quot;Bookstand of Hespera&quot; several times. Perhaps I should also get one, if it turns out I will be working a lot with texts.

The Lab will be quite big, so I hope to refine it as soon as possible. That should also free space for a number of faerie creatures I intend to employ as helpers and experimentation objects.

I have decided to set up my living quarters in the lab for the first decade or so, leaving the room on the first floor unoccupied. This will allow me to see my early projects through easier. I plan on relocating upstairs in the future, using the space made available for other purposes.

====First Season: Invention of Aegis of the Heart====

I have successfully finished my first laboratory project, the development of an Aegis spell. While work went smoothly, the laboratory is far from finished, as I have to rearrange things to include the tree with its Vis Source more prominently. The spell seems to work very well, though a calamity happened upon the first casting. I took some [[Notes on the adverse effect of Vim spells gone awry|notes]] on that.

I will spent the next seasons finishing the laboratory outfittings to a state where I deem them appropriate. That should help with future work, which will not always be as simple as this Aegis spell.

====Second Season: Invention of Communion with the Forest====

My second project is finished, the invention of a spell titled &quot;communion with the forest&quot;. However, a strange incidence has transpired during the procedure. I have written a [[Notes on the effects of a Vis Source present during spell invention|set of notes]] on this.

Nonetheless, I have to note that everything appears to be working fine. The laboratory is not quite finished - I plan on taking a number of semi-intelligent fae in as specimen and helpers - but it is a pleasant place to work already.

====Third Season: Vis Extraction====

I have again had need of my laboratory, and shall have even more in the future. Extracting Vis works fine, though I needed to do some extra hours to get the amount I was aiming for. I found out, though, that the organisation of my equipment is somewhat suboptimal. While I noticed a few minutes in advance a possible calamity due to the arrangement, the danger is only averted for a while, and I should do something about it. I haven't figured out what exactly to rearrange to improve the safety, but I will pay particular attention during whatever activity I shall perform next.

====Fourth Season: Fixing Arcane Connection====

My [[Aphanius visits the Court of Bright Winter|recent exploits]] have met with success, and I am now in possession of an Arcane Connection to none less than the ruler of the local faerie court. This will not only prove invaluable in research that likeley lies decades in the future, but also provides a certain safety to [[Waldheim]] should the Lady decide to withdraw her approval of our presence.

I immediately undertook to fixate the connection in my Laboratory, a demeaning task, but since a lock of hair will not last long it has to be undertaken now, lest my effort was in vain. I paid more attention to the arrangement of my equipment during this task, and I think I have come upon the reason for the near-failure of my past efforts. It will not be simple to mend this deficiency, but I think with some rearrengement and the inclusion of smaller servant creatures that can undertake mean tasks such as carrying phials and the like, it will be possible to lessen or even compensate for the sheer size of the lab, which is at the heart of the problem.

====Fifth Season: Creating the Helmet of the Hunter of Hermes====

I have been thinking, and as expected have come upon a brilliant result.

Primo, I shall state the circumstances: In the Westerwald, there is a certain amount of Vis available for harvest to whoever stumbles upon it. Our agreement with [[Turris Glorium]] states that the hunting ground is fair and free for both of us. This Vis is not appearing in the same spots, but seems to be the result of spontaneous manifestations. Nonetheless, it is in the forest when it should be in our Covenant stores.

Secoundo, I shall state the problem: Harvesting this Vis is a time-consuming effort. It can not be expected for a fullfledged magus - except, perhaps, for those of Ex Misc or similarly inferior and ill-bred houses - to spend valuable seasons scouring the undergrowth for Vis, as the Westerwald is large and therefore the expected seasonal yield is far below acceptable. Further complicating the issue is the matter of finding and identifying the Vis: If ones main purpose is to gather as much as possible, it is a simple logical consequence that the highest standards of perception should be applied, id est, magic. But casting spells repeatedly in a faerie or magic aura carries an inert danger, and an item will warp its weilder, again barring any sensible magus from such an undertaking.

Tertio, I shall state the solution: I have made plans for an item that transfers a vision of Vis to its weilder, and have already acquired a skilled hunter for service in [[Waldheim]]. Two years have passed and he has proven himself worthy. Of course I am keeping an Arcane Connection to him, in case he ever decides on some rash course of action, but I will equip him with a Helmet that allows his Hunts to include a search for Vis. The Warping will make him useless within a number of years, but by then he will be to old anyhow, and finding a suitable replacement is not a problem. Thus I have devised a method to gather as much of this Vis as a magus could, without any magus having to submit himself to the time-consuming effort and the dangers it entails. I am brilliant indeed.

Quarto, the enchantment of the device itself. In this I was aided for the first time by the lesser fae I have procured from the [[Court of Dark Summer]] ... (tbc)

''(This play-by-wiki was the conclusion of the [[Notes on the measures taken against the disturbance of the fairy forest by the settlement attempt made by the nephew of the count of Nassau|Hömberg adventure]].)''

== The Initial Situation ==

It is December 1226, a couple of days after the full moon. Over the last five nights, several of the characters have been involved in investigating some strange occurences in a [[Hömberg|new small village]] in the Westerwald, a few miles to the southeast of [[Waldheim]] and a few miles north of the town of Nassau on the River Lahn. A couple of people in particular are of interest:

* Sir Peter Nassau: a minor nobleman, and nephew of the Count of Nassau. It seems he received permission from his uncle for the founding of Hömberg, by clearing some virgin forest.
* &quot;Sir [[Victor]]&quot;: a man posing as a travelling nobleman and hunter, staying as a guest of Peter. It was later found out that he is actually a Redcap who was on his way to the covenant, after he revealed himself.

A brief summary of what has happened so far:

* The villagers believed themselves to be the victims of wolf attacks (indeed a small handful of villagers have gone missing or been found dead). In actual fact, the village appears to be suffering a curse of lycanthrophy: on the nights on and around the full moon, several of the villagers have transformed into wolves, some of which were killed by other villagers on the hunt. The slain wolves were later found as dead humans in the forest.

* Both the clearing of the forest and the attacks on some of the real Faerie wolves of the Westerwald has displeased the [[Court of Bright Winter]]; through [[Torven]]'s wolf Red-Hame, they have asked the magi of Waldheim for aid.

* Torven was found as a captive of Sir Peter, believed to be somehow in league with the wolves (actually true). Aphanius, under the guise of Bertram, skillfully promised to deliver Torven to the count on behalf of Sir Peter. 

* Torven was actually freed, but Aphanius told the count (whom he had met once before) that he was killed when he attempted to escape and the body burnt.

* Vexator and Undine were summoned from [[Pfalz Island]] by a message disguised as a cheese!

* Undine stayed with Sir Peter and offered the assistance of the grogs with her in the hunt.

* On several nights, various of the characters were involved in hunting and searching in the forest, investigating the bodies of wolves and villagers, and so on.

* The grog [[Horridus]] (from [[Crintera]]) seems to have the ability to shapeshift into a horse.

* Relentus was captured and placed in a cage near to Sir Peter's manor house. He was rescued thanks to some Rego Mentem spells from Undine to put the guards to sleep.

* A wolfberry tree whose fruits are Animal vis was discovered a short way off in the forest. [[Ludold]], Waldheim's elder, suggested that it may be a warding tree of some sort. Perhaps it is thus related to the lycanthropy?

At least some of the magi (most principally the [[Ash Gild]] contingent) have suggested that it would be highly desirable if the new village were to &quot;disappear&quot;. (As a point of Hermetic Law, the [[Rhine Tribunal]] has a famous peripheral code ruling permitting involvement in mundane affairs in order to protect wilderness areas... or at least this ruling is sometimes upheld, for example [[Dankmar]] were found to be not guilty even though they were believed to be involved in the removal of a monastery in the [[Black Forest]].)

Exactly how this is to be achieved remains to be seen...

----

== The plan by Vexator and Aphanius ==

Aphanius and Vexator were already set on a plan: Remove Peter from the scene, convince the settlers to move away, and then have the church relocated to Kaub - in a new building the covenant would sponsor, to show its dedication to the christian faith. The idea was that the magic of the Westerwald would stay untouched, and to outside mundane eyes they would be seen to act in favour of the church - something very important given the history of the Rhine Gorge, in particular certain events involving armies and archbishops.

All they had to do was set the plan in motion.

=== Plan the First: Disincentivise Sir Peter ===

Therefore, Aphanius first approaches Vexator Sylvanum:

&quot;''Trusted colleague! I would like to ask you to enact the first part of our plan. Since you have proven to be the most combatworthy of us in the past, could you take care of Peter? I will take full responsibilty for his death and that of any guards he may have with him. Anything beyond that will be on you. Just make sure he won't be around in the future. I suggest you take Hademar and Hartwig with you, but in the end how you do it and whom you take is of course up to you.''

''I will ask Undine to convince the mortals to leave, preferably towards Kaub. I'll then have the faeries regrow the forest over the former huts. Everything will look like normal, except for that ulcer of a church. Concerning it's relocation, I will do that with Albrecht.''

''If I can assist you in any way, be it by providing invisibility or firepower, just let me know.''&quot;

Vexator ponders a bit on this.

&quot;''I agree that we need to get rid of Sir Peter. Let me propose this plan of action: I will hide near the roads of Hömburg. We will trick Sir Peter into leaving the village by writing a letter, or sending a messenger. Some Rego Animal magics should be enough to get his horse to rebel, resulting in a terrible, terrible riding accident. Then, our group will assist Sir Peter and his men in bringing Sir Peter to a healer. On our way, I can secretly cast massive Perdo Corpus magics. I have a spell that can start a heavy wound in a person. This I could cast... oh... ten to twenty times on Sir Peter. The healer will then only see a very tragic riding accident with a totally unforeseen massive injury outcome. I highly doubt that Sir Peter will survive the wounds resulting from ten repeated castings of my Perdo spell.''&quot;

Vexator nods. &quot;''Yes, that sounds like a good plan. That way, no-one is responsible for his death, accidents do happen, after all.''&quot;

Aphanius smiles at the proposal of his colleague.

&quot;''An excellent plan. I like it a lot. No overt magic involved, no mysterious assassins - all very well. Will you require my invisibility spell, or will you rely on mundane means for hiding?''&quot;

&quot;''I think I will hide out with a few grogs without using the invisibility spell. We need to communicate with the men of Sir Peter, after all. I might need the grogs for diversions, to be able to stealthily cast the Rego and Perdo magics.''&quot;

&quot;''Very well. Take whom you need. Tell me when you're done, so we can set Undine in motion.''&quot;

&quot;''Come to think of it, perhaps your invisibility spell may be of use. You could hide in the woods with us, invisible yourself. Then, cast the invisibility spell on myself. I will then levitate (so that I don't make any noises) towards the Sir Peter group. ReAn spell to let the horse rebel, a PeCo spell immediately after, to make sure that Sir Peter is actually 'wounded' from the riding accident. Then, I will quickly levitate back to you that you can dispell the invisibility spell. Then, I will take the grogs and march along the road, meeting Sir Peter 'by accident',''&quot; Vexator chuckles, &quot;''pun entirely intended...''&quot;

Aphanius also chuckles.

&quot;''Very well, let's head out. I assume Hademar and Hartwig shall be fitting?''&quot;

&quot;''Perhaps Hademar is a little too intimidating. Hartwig, someone other, and my trusted shield grog Jaqueline should suffice. I do not expect to start a fight. At least not a fair and even one.''&quot;

&quot;''Very well. We'll leave Hademar with Undine, in case she gets into any trouble. I'll take my shield grog too, then, for the way back.''&quot;

After that, Aphanius goes to write a letter to Peter von Nassau, citing urgent business and his need to arrive at his uncle's - not in his own hand, of course. He will deliver it via some happless grog, and upon Peter receiving it state that when he visited the count (to deliver Torven), he had heard there was something important, but as it appeared to be family business had kept his nose out.

As soon as Peter sets out, the five follow him (in a certain distance) to set their plan in motion.

=== Plan the Second: Convincing the Villagemen to Leave ===

Aphanius seeks out Undine:

&quot;''Dear colleague! As you seem to have a way with mortals and some compassion for them, I would ask you to do something for our covenant. Could you try and convince the inhabitants of Hömburg to find a new home after the tragic early death of their better, Peter von Nassau? Perhaps some of them can even be put to work in Kaub - Albrecht had plans of establishing a tavern there, so you could talk to him.''

''Rest assured that there is no need for you to embark on the quest if you don't want to, or even to succeed - if not, we still have the option of slaughtering the useless lot right where they live. It'd be less of a hassle if we wouldn't have to, though.''&quot;

=== Plan the Third: Getting the Wood to Reclaim the Village ===

Aphanius plans to have the Faeries regrow the forest over night once there is noone left at the scene.

=== Plan the Fourth: Relocating the Church ===

Then, he will write a letter to Albrecht:

&quot;''Albrecht! I have asked Undine to do something, which I assume she will do. Help her best as you can.

''There is also another matter where I require your assistance. A petition will have to be sent to the local clerical authority - I believe the bishop is the right rank, but would be grateful if you could make sure - regarding the relocation of a church that stands alone and unused in the forest.''

''Our covenant will sponsor the construction of a new church in Kaub. I trust you will find a way to make this affordable. This church will be the recipient of the relocation procedure, so if you could help Undine settle some of the people from former Hömburg in Kaub it would strengthen our argument.''

''You could also use the manpower from Kaub to found a small new business - a tavern, a few fishers, something like that. It should help lessen the financial strain we are incurring in your yearly reports. Again, I trust you will find something suitable.''

''I will personally travel to the covenant to meet you when matters here are done, to write the petition. I will likely take a week or two, and expect everything will be in place once I arrive.''&quot;

----

== Part 1: Getting Rid of a Redcap ==

As Aphanius and Vexator are making their way out of Hömberg, ready to set their dastardly plan in action, the Redcap Victor rides up. He is quite splendidly attired, seemingly a dashing nobleman out on the hunt. His impressive-looking horse snorts boldly, seemingly undisturbed by the presence of the two young magi.

''&quot;Salve sodales! A most unfortunate business, this trouble with the wolves, no? Going from what you have said, it may be best for me to curtail my hunting for the time being, since it would be most rude of me to bother your local faeries and such. Perhaps I may be able to stay with Sir Peter for hunting upon my next visit... quite an agreeable fellow, really. Anyway, I have thus decided to make my way to your fine covenant! However can I be of assistance with this matter in any way before I depart?&quot;''

Aphanius stops and smiles at the Redcap.

''&quot;Salve sodalis! We have taxed your will to assist too much already. Just go on to Pfalz Island, Albrecht will provide all you need. Vexator and Undine shall join you there once this ghastly business with the fae is settled. I'm certain next time you visit everything will have been worked out, and you can continue your hunting undisturbed. Right now I fear it's not too safe for anyone lacking magic protection. You've seen what happened to those poor innocent villagers. I will not have a fine Redcap such as you being hurt around our covenant.&quot;''

And with that, he waves Victor away, following Vexator on his way out.

== Part 2: A Freak Riding Accident ==

Sir Peter takes the note from the grog and reads it with a frown. It is a faked letter telling of his uncle's displeasure at the recent deaths in the village and summoning him without delay. Sure enough, after some hasty preparations, he mounts up and makes his way south, accompanied by one of his men-at-arms on another horse.

The two riders gallop their way along the crude road south. Peter's companion carries a torch, to ward off the winter gloom beneath the trees...

Peter's horse suddenly stops, shrieks out, and rears wildly. The nobleman struggles manfully to stay on, and resists for several moments... But the horse is beyond all control, thrashing wildly, and finally throws him off. His companion brings his horse under control and glances fearfully through the surrounding dark trees, drawing his axe.

''&quot;Aauuughh!&quot;'' Peter screams out, falling badly and clutching at his ankle. He struggles to hobble out of the way of his still-thrashing horse. The other man dismounts and moves to help him... when suddenly, Sir Peter screams out even more, holding his stomach. His face convulsed in pain, he manages to limp to the side of the road. Peter's companion glances around, but fails to see anyone (or anything). Slightly shaken, he goes to his master. ''&quot;Sir Peter! What is the matter?&quot;'' -- ''&quot;Argh, the pain... what happened?&quot;''

Vexator floats silently, and invisibly back to the group. Aphanius dispells the invisibility effect on Vexator and the grogs, then heads back to Hömberg with Günther (still invisible). He reminds Vexator to remove the letter at an opportune moment and destroy it - wouldn't do to leave hints that something was not natural. Vexator relays these orders to Jacqueline. ''&quot;This is a good test to see if you can pick the letter from Sir Peter without anyone knowing. As a woman, I'll let you care for him. Perhaps wait until Sir Peter is in delirium or in too much pain to notice anything.&quot;'' Jacqueline reacts with the merest hint of a sceptical frown, but covers it up well -- by now she knows better than to question orders. ''&quot;Very well, master. Just as you say.&quot;''

Vexator and his group move up the road to Hömberg. After a short while, they reach the place of the accident. By now Sir Peter's companion has managed to calm his master's horse, which is tied to a nearby tree. He stands from next to his lying master and reaches for his axe, eyeing the arriving group suspiciously. ''&quot;Good day, sirs!&quot;'' Vexator greets. ''&quot;Sir Peter! What happened?&quot;'' Vexator, feigning shock and surprise, goes to Sir Peter. The companion tries to move between Sir Peter and Vexator, but Sir Peter, looking up, manages to wave him away. ''&quot;I know this man... he is... from a... nearby castle... they have... helped us to... combat the wolves...&quot;'' Vexator orders his two male grogs to fetch some wood and build a stretcher: ''&quot;Quickly, he seems badly wounded!&quot;'' Jacqueline is given the task to keep an eye on the wounded Sir Peter. The man-at-arms still has a suspicious look on his face, but he lets the woman approach. After a quick glance, Vexator adds ''&quot;We need to get him to a healer... these pains are a sign of an internal injury. I am not a very good healer myself, but I have seen similar accidents! Once the stretcher is ready, we'll move him, very carefully, to Nassau. I can call for the healer from our castle to take a look at Sir Peter. Would that be okay with you, Sir Peter? And, you,&quot;'' Vexator points to the companion, ''&quot;take a look what those guys are doing for so long... the stretcher needs to be ready, the sooner the better!&quot;'' The man hesitates for a moment with lingering suspicion... ''&quot;As you say, m'lord.&quot;'' He heads off to help the others.

Once he is out of the way, Vexator casts another dose of ''The Wound that Kills'', using quiet voices and subtle gestures, when Sir Peter isn't looking and preoccupied with his pain. ''&quot;Mmm-aauurghhh!&quot;'' the knight groans anew, choking blood, ''&quot;what... devilry is this?!&quot;'' Jacqueline places her palm firmly across his mouth to inhibit any further outbursts. ''&quot;Hush now, my lord. No trouble, eh?&quot;'' His latest groan of agony is thus muffled, but his eyes roll in their sockets as another grievous wound hits home, Vexator taking care to cast while out of Sir Peter's line of sight, and whilst &quot;talking&quot; to Jacqueline. One of the other grogs is sent to the covenant to get the healer to the village nearby. 

While the group moves slowly to the village, bearing the now-delirious Sir Peter on a makeshift stretcher, Vexator casts another few of the PeCo spells... His victim falls unconscious from the pain. The magus takes care not do this openly, only using subtle words and gestures, and only when the other is preoccupied. On account of the injuries of Sir Peter, the pace is very slow...

''&quot;Halt!&quot;'' Jacqueline cries out, drawing her bow. ''&quot;Did you hear that?!&quot;'' She glances around the group. ''&quot;Blasted wolves again...&quot;'' she mutters, moving off to one side, to peer through the dark forest. ''&quot;Stay here master, I'll go check&quot;'' And with that, she hurries off beneath the trees. For a minute or two there is silence...

''&quot;Here!&quot;'' Jacqueline's muffled voice cries out, from a way off. ''&quot;Wolves! Help!&quot;'' The man-at-arms frowns and hefts his axe, glancing at Vexator. The magus only shrugs. ''&quot;I must stay with Sir Peter. You two,&quot;'' he gestures at the stranger and one of the grogs, ''&quot;go help&quot;''. The two of them sprint off in Jacqueline's general direction and then there are several further moments' silence. ''&quot;Where are you, woman?!&quot;'' the sergeant calls out gruffly from a distance beneath the trees. Vexator turns around as Jacqueline slips out silently from the other side of the forest and swiftly drops to Sir Peter's side, grabbing the handful of parchments from the knight's satchel. She stuffs them inside her jerkin just in time, before the others return. ''&quot;There you are!&quot;'' the warrior exclaims, panting. ''&quot;Where are the wolves? What happened?&quot;'' ''&quot;Got one, I think,&quot;'' she responds, hefting her bow, ''&quot;but where the hell were you when I needed you?!&quot;'' The other shrugs, confused. ''&quot;Never mind!&quot;'' Vexator barks with his slightly unnatural authority, ''&quot;get moving again!&quot;''

An hour or two before nightfall, the group emerges from the forest and descends down the hillside into Nassau, crossing the wooden bridge over the river, and heading for the castle. As they approach, a small crowd gathers, gasping in recognition of Sir Peter and his deathly countenance. As they are finding a place to lay the stretcher, an elderly woman runs down from the castle, trailed by a serving woman struggling with a basket and a pail of water. ''&quot;Here, let me look at him!&quot;'' she exclaims, ''&quot;what on earth happened?&quot;'' She sets to work without delay, leaving Vexator and the others to step back.

As night falls, the chaos of onlookers, relatives, and healers gets more urgent. Their efforts are in vain, however, as it becomes clear that Sir Peter has succumbed to his internal wounds. The ashen body lies motionless, surrounded by several tearful relatives. The count, a gruff, bulky man of advanced years is interrogating the man-at-arms vigorously. Over the sobbing of the women, Vexator hears him reply, ''&quot;Truly I am sorry my lord! There was nothing I could do! The horse suddenly reared, and he fell, but it didn't seem all that bad...&quot;''

After finishing his questions, the count turns towards Vexator and the grogs. There is no small measure of suspicion mixed in with the lines of grief and stress on his face. His hand shifts, perhaps unconsciously, to the hilt of his sword. ''&quot;You, stranger! If you have helped my nephew, as may be the case, then you have my gratitude, but I trust you are not somehow involved with this? These have been ill times indeed in the new settlement, I hear. So, perhaps you can tell me, Sir, who are you, and what in God's name has happened there?&quot;'''

''&quot;Sire, good day! It seems you do not recognise me... let me introduce myself, my name is Friedrich aus Schwaben. I had the opportunity and the honour to be your guest, together with a certain Bertram some years back. Today, we, that is, my companions and I, were walking along the road to Hömberg, when we found Sir Peter here badly wounded. His companion told us that Sir Peter had fallen off his horse. I immediately set up everything so that we could get him to safety and to healing hands. It seems... we were too late.&quot;'' Vexator poses a gloomy look. ''&quot;A great tragedy... we had just visited Sir Peter in Hömberg, and he was a most delightful and courteous host.&quot;''

The count stares intently at the young magus, eyebrows furrowed in either suspicion or deep thought. ''&quot;Hmm, Bertram you say, the strange... scholarly fellow with the peculiar skin, you mean? In fact he was here only the other day! It seems a troublemaker from some forest hamlet had been captured by Peter, and he was executed when he tried to escape. The accident happened around the same place, it seems. I am not a superstitious man, but I fear there may be some kind of witchcraft going on here.&quot;''

He continues ''&quot;Anyway, now that you mention it, I believe that we may have met before, yes, with this Bertram. You are doubtless a wealthy scholar, like he... From that new fortress on the Rhine island, yes? Still, it is a shame your scholarly talents do not extend to medicine, since such a riding fall is not usually fatal.&quot;'' He grimaces bitterly. ''&quot;Forgive me. No doubt you did all that you could. I am grateful for it. Still, if you should see Bertram, tell him that I would wish to speak with him. He seems to be a learned man, and he lives in these parts, so he may be able to shed some light on just who, or what, is responsible for all this wickedness and confusion.&quot;''

The count does not seem completely convinced by Vexator's explanation, but nevertheless leaves him to attend to several others. After some time, &quot;Friedrich&quot; and the grogs will be able to make their excuses and leave the next day.

== Part 3: When the North Wind Blows ==

After the freak riding accident, Aphanius seeks out Undine again. The two wait for a few days, until a messenger arrives carrying the news of the terrible accident that has befallen Sir Peter. In the meantime, Aphanius creates the shapes of big wolves prowling the village at dusk and dawn, using spontaneous Creo Imaginem Spells while invisible. He adds the howls of wolves in the night, too - more frequent as time draws on.

These measures only add to the fear of the villagers, who are now loath to leave Hömberg at all, or travel alone. News of Sir Peter's death is greeted by dismay and horror, and there are several who now speak or whisper of a curse. The village priest does his best to alleviate these anxieties, and many gather for prayer at the chapel. Still, there are no further attacks, and the only evidence of the presence of wolves are Aphanius' spells.

Undine and Aphanius move in on the day following the messenger's arrival. Aphanius tells the villagers that probably god doesn't want them to settle there, seeing as he has taken fit to take Sir Peter to him so early. Since danger is mounting (the fear of wolves attacking should be very present now), Undine suggests they resettle, for example near the village of Kaub (where Albrecht will find an opportunity to employ them). Aphanius (who should be basically known by now) gives the impression that he is very concerned about their fate, while Undine plays the nice woman who by chance has an opportunity for them to take up a new live elsewhere.

That afternoon, the villagers gather in a crowd by the palisade around the manor house, huddled together against the cold, to hear the speakers. Undine talks with some eloquence about the opportunities in Kaub, and she is generally well-received. Several of the villagers appear to be considering this, and discuss it with each other. There are a number of questions put to the maga -- what kind of accomodation would they get, what kind of work is available, that kind of thing. Eventually, the afternoon wears on and Aphanius steps up to speak. The grateful smiles and hopeful faces that greeted Undine meld into visages of fear and suspicion as the slightly sinister-looking Tremere speaks. Nevertheless, he speaks cleverly, with his faerie gift for persuasion, and appears to be effective in playing to the villagers' fears and superstitions. However, when he speaks of God's disfavour on the village, the priest interrupts. ''&quot;No!&quot;'' he cries out from the crowd, ''&quot;I'll not hear that! This village and this church were founded with the Lord's blessing! God is with Hömberg! But these attacks and these deaths... they are the Devil's doing! We must be stronger in our faith!&quot;'' There is some agreement in the crowd, but others are more inclined to Aphanius' position, and discussion and argument breaks out. 

Dusk is approaching, and the gloom deepens in the empty fields surrounded by forest, as Aphanius delivers his retort to the priest.

''&quot;Brave man, I have no doubt of your faith. You certainly are strong, all of you, for taking up such an endeavour as the founding of this village. But can you not see that the Devil is a clever beast? He subverts your strength, making you think you follow faith while corrupting you all the time. Winter is ahead. Times are hard, and now the Lord of this village has fallen in some wicked accident. Can't you see that it is the Devil that is telling you to stay here, playing on your pride? If you do not listen to the signs of the Lord, not only will you die in the cold, but you will die in sin, damning your souls with your pride. Your faith is stronger than that, I know that. Don't let him fool you. Humility is what he asks, and humility he shall receive, from all of us.&quot;''

The wind picks up stiffly, billowing the Tremere's robes, and snowflakes begin to blow, stinging the villagers' faces. Undine looks on in admiration -- most impressive, how the magus seems to be effortlessly summoning the weather and darkness to underline his arguments! But as he speaks on, he struggles to make himself overheard over the wind. The maga frowns -- this appears to be not his magic after all... Aphanius pauses to glance questioningly at the Bjornaer -- ''is this your doing?'', he seems to be asking, but the maga only shrugs in confusion by way of response.

The priest struggles bravely to speak up against Aphanius, but he is almost impossible to hear over the now howling wind. The shivering villagers struggle to see past the driving snow, and huddle together in fear. Several of the torches are blown out.

From the north, from deeper in the forest, a great storm appears to be rising... The iron-grey clouds that heralded the dusk have strangled the last of the light from the heavens, and the freezing snow is beginning to form in drifts. Mixed in with the wrathful howling of the winds, there almost seem to be faint animal howls -- but not quite the same as Aphanius' phantom wolves. The stormy tumult increases in intensity, and the villagers begin to back away towards their meagre houses and the chapel as Aphanius struggles to control his flapping cloak. The ground trembles slightly, as if with the approach of hooves, and... was that a horn blowing above the wind's call? The wind and blinding snow scream through the pitiful settlement and panic begins to break out...

''&quot;Into the church! All of you! Pray for delivery!&quot;'', Aphanius commands at the top of his voice, as the sound of the horn is heard. Not all hear this order, however, and some of the panicked folk flee blindly. Others head for their own dwellings, but most clump together and run for the small church. Aphanius waves Gunther to collect the stragglers and stops by Undine. ''&quot;Accompany them inside. Make sure no-one goes out. And try to work on that priest a bit.&quot;'' Knowing that any spells he could spontaneously cast will not be strong enough to stop what is about to come, he ponders for a few precious moments. Then he turns to Gunther. ''&quot;You, too, go inside. Stay with Undine, follow her commands.&quot;'' The burly veteran finishes shoving two villagers through the church doorway and nods curtly. It is clear that he thinks he should stay by his master's side, but he knows better than to query his orders. ''&quot;As you say, Master Aphanius.&quot;'' Luckily in the confusion no-one notices this minor breach of &quot;Bertram&quot;'s disguise.

Aphanius stands his ground a short way from the church. Thanks to his dark faerie blood, he does not seem overly bothered by either the dark or the cold, but even he feels a tremor in his bones, guessing at what is to come. The remaining villagers are by now either hidden in the church, or else they have fled out of sight. The freezing ground now resonates more strongly with hoofbeats... The young magus draws a deep breath and incants a Creo Ignem spell. Drawing his arms wide, light blooms over him from above, as if a bright torch was held over his head.

The hunt storms into the village, seemingly riding the battering winds and snows. The figures are hard to discern through the blizzard, but there appear to be about a dozen horsemen, on great dark mounts. The vast grey hounds leaping before them are more numerous still. They howl above the crescendo, cries which echo with the icy winds of the utmost north. Behind them rides a greater figure still... Aphanius' suspicions are confirmed; he recognises the legendary Wild Hunt, which he has heard about as an apprentice at Fengheld -- a great troupe of Winter faeries who roam through the forests of northern and central Germany, whispered of in villagers' nightmares. He hastily casts another spell, a Rego Corpus, levitating himself slowly out of the way of the oncoming ghostly riders.

Buffeted by the streaming winds which are slowly starting to blow him back, the magus struggles to navigate his way through the air and snowstorm to the church, a couple of dozen yards away. Fortunately, his spell allows for some horizontal movement, and he so he advances erratically against the wind as the Wild Hunt gallops through the centre of Hömberg, forking to either side around the church. The feral howls of the great dogs almost seem to have a life of their own, leaping through the air to gnash just beyond Aphanius' ears, as he settles unsteadily on the peaked roof. There is a momentarily strange sensation of weakness, as he feels the power of his lift and his magical light tremble and waver. At the same time, however, he feels a flicker of warmth and courage stir within him. Once on top of the roof, he draws his sword and kneels down in a heroic pose, holding the sword hilt up in front of him with his hands, the tip resting on the roof. He chants a prayer from his time in the monastery...

The Hunt and its accompanying storm rage around the outskirts of the village for several minutes. Distantly, the praying Tremere can see some of the fleeing villagers being chased down. One of the hounds leaps upon a stumbling man and delivers a mighty bite. The victim slumps to the ground, horror frozen upon his face. There is a crash as one of the flimsy dwellings falls down, and distant screams. Several horsemen charge into its ruins and ride down the inhabitants. Others leap effortlessly over -- or through? -- the palisade and charge up to the manor house. Aside from the church, the Hunt lays waste to Hömberg...

== Part 4: Winter Kills ==

As the destruction seemingly reaches a conclusion, the greatest figure, the Wild Huntsman himself, finally approaches the church. His riders and hounds gather menacingly some way behind him, just perceptible through the snow and gloom. The winds are momentarily stilled, here, at the eye of the storm. The great grim figure is wrapped entirely in a sullen grey robe, and he sits atop an immense black horse. With his long spear, he bashes on the church door thrice, seemingly by way of a challenge, each strike accompanied by a chilling blast of wind. The flimsy building tremors beneath Aphanius, and he struggles to control his levitation magics... he manages to maintain a grasp on his spell, just! 

The winds subside again to a freezing stillness. There is no sound but a faint, fearful sobbing and praying from within the church. The wooden door creaks open. Gunther, sword drawn, stands in the doorway, Undine and the priest peering from behind him.

The rider gestures to the grog. ''&quot;RIDE WITH ME, MORTAL!&quot;'' he calls out, in a chilling boom. There is the hint of a shining helm or mask behind his robe. Most lesser men would have fled in panic at this, but the grog bravely stands his ground. He glances up at the magus on the roof... Aphanius shakes his head -- he has heard tell that a mortal rider may empower the Hunt with deadly vitality.

''&quot;Huntsman!&quot;'' Aphanius calls out from his precarious position on the roof, ''&quot;The church and the people inside are mine, but you may claim everything else in the village!&quot;'' The mighty rider cocks his head to one side, as if in the briefest moment of thought. ''&quot;NO. ALL WILL PERISH BEFORE THE HUNT.&quot;'' he growls icily. The magus gulps and summons his courage, remembering the training of his House and Gild. He has no doubt that he is facing one of the most powerful faeries in the land. ''&quot;I challenge you in the name of the Lady of Bright Winter!&quot;'' he issues. ''&quot;I ANSWER HER SUMMONS!&quot;'' the robed figure retorts, although it is not clear if he means that the Hunt was called here by the Court, or if he is merely accepting the challenge, or perhaps both. ''&quot;I will face one of your number in a duel,&quot;'' the magus proposes, ''&quot;and if -- when! -- I win, you will leave this place unharmed. If you agree to leave the church in any case, then I will not fight with the aid of my... special gifts.&quot;'' ''&quot;I WILL FIGHT YOU,&quot;'', the faerie lord responds immediately, ''&quot;BUT IF I PREVAIL, I WILL CLAIM WINTER'S SPOILS AS MY DUE.&quot;''

The Wild Huntsman dismounts with a deep thump, and his insubstantial mount seems to fade into the background. Aphanius levitate-slides down the small roof, still clutching his sword, and hits the ground unsteadily, letting his Rego Corpus magics subside. The two figures square off, one still illuminated by magical light, the other wreathed in shadow, with the occasional silvery glint. The dark robed figure, towering over the magus, reaches inside his robe and withdraws a glittering blade of ice with a hiss. Aphanius, pausing momentarily for thought, chants in Latin and deftly skips to one side. As the Huntsman advances ominously, clutching his ice-blade in both gauntleted hands, the Tremere lets loose with his Perdo Vim spell. There is no noticable response.

The Huntsman smoothly steps up, accompanied by a sudden blast of wind, and slashes at -- or rather, through -- Aphanius, whose image flickers and reappears a yard away, seemingly unharmed. His opponent hisses wrathfully, and begins to probe more cautiously. Aphanius lets loose another casting of his Perdo Vim magics. Again, no response can be discerned. Steeling himself manfully, he strides forth to strike at the faerie... a credible effort, but parried with ease. The robed figure still holds back, and raises one hand. The snow on the ground suddenly whips up in a maelstrom, buffeting the image of the magus. A yard to one side of the illusion, snow sticks to the robes of an invisible figure. The Huntsman strides forward with a wintry roar, and thrusts his icy blade squarely into the chest of Aphanius, who clutches at his body with a mortal gasp, letting his sword fall to his side. He feels the blade slice effortlessly through his Parma Magica and deep into his breast, a chilling agony that freezes his veins to ice... The illusion and the snowflake-coated invisible magus both simultaneously slump to the ground in the snow, motionless.

Inside the church, some were peering through the shutters at the duel, but now shrink back in horror at its outcome. The Wild Huntsman steps past the body and approaches... However he stops short a pace away from the church to sniff and probe at the air... After a brief moment he turns away, with a curt gesture summoning his great mount which rushes out of nothingness to his side. ''&quot;WE RIDE!&quot;'' he bellows. The Wild Hunt rises up and gallops off, as quickly as it had arrived, the trembling ground and snowstorm gradually subsiding in their wake as they penetrate the forest to the southeast of the clearing, and disappear.

Undine emerges from the church with a cry, one hand across her mouth in disbelief, and rushes over to the motionless body of Aphanius. His strangely dark skin, still illuminated by the light of his own magics, seems pallid and frozen. Snow begins to settle over his Tremere robes...

== Part 5: The Morning After ==

Aphanius awakes suddenly with a hollow gasp, clutching at his still deathly-cold chest. He is inside the crude church -- which is mostly intact -- lying beside an improvised fire. The concerned faces of Undine and the priest hover over him. ''&quot;The Lord be praised&quot;'' the priest murmurs, ''&quot;I thought we had lost him for certain!&quot;'' as Undine presses a mug of warm broth into his hand. With his other hand, he fumbles inside his robes, searching for the wound in his chest... but it is not there, just the phantom trace of a mortal sword blow.

He is still too weak to speak, but Undine reports that a small number of the villagers have died from the cold; they were found lying in the fields where they had been attacked, although their bodies bore no obvious wounds. Some others were found alive; they are now huddled in the church, trembling uncontrollably, terror still etched on their wretched faces, unwilling to speak of what they have seen.

Undine spends some time in an energetic discussion with the priest. The stubborn churchman seems determined to stay it out in Hömberg, but the persistent maga eventually wins him over. The priest then announces the decision to the remaining villagers: that they should retreat south to Nassau to see out the winter, and then return to Hömberg in the spring to rebuild. All seem happy at the prospect of leaving, but not all are enthused at the notion of returning after the winter is over. Preparations are made to leave...

After returning to Pfalz Island, and being checked over by Heinrich, it seems that Aphanius bears no discernable wounds. Within a couple of days, the chill and fatigue fades away. Having time to reflect on these events, the young Tremere recalls that the weapons of the riders and the teeth of the hounds only strike with mortal force if the Hunt is accompanied by a mortal rider. Otherwise, lacking true vitality, their only weapons are fear and cold. Lacking such a human hunter amongst his troupe, the Huntsman was thus only able to strike with terror and chills -- fearsome enough weapons, but not deadly. It seems the Tremere has survived his first encounter with the Wild Hunt.

== Part 6: A New Recruit ==

Aphanius has had his eye on one of the inhabitants of the village, a young hunter named Emelric who seems to be suitable. He seemed to be a bit of a loner during the recent events and didn't seem overly spooked by the magus' Creo Imaginem magics. He accepts Aphanius' offer to come and work for him in Waldheim; he is sent to hunt and forage for food to support the hamlet, at first.

== Part 7: Correspondence with the Church ==

Meanwhile, in Kaub, some of the homeless villagers arrive in search of work and shelter... which is hastily arranged by Vexator and Albrecht. With the assistance of Aphanius, Albrecht drafts a letter to the local bishop (after some inquiry, it is found that the local bishop is in fact the Archbishop of Trier). In this letter, they request the deconsecration of the small church of Hömberg, offering instead to fund the construction of a new church in Kaub, where many of the worshippers are to be resettled. Aphanius and Albrecht try their best to support this request with theological argument... and, in case that is not persuasive enough, the letter is also accompanied with a generous donation to the Church.

A month or two later, a reply from one of the archbishop's functionaries is delivered. The Church will agree to the proposal, if the Count of Nassau also consents. In due course, the agreement of the count is indeed forthcoming. A churchman from Koblenz thus arrives at the remains of Hömberg for the ceremony of deconsecration, which is discreetly witnessed by Aphanius. There will be no return to the village.

== Part 8: No Place Like Hömberg ==

It is late Spring 1228, over a year since the attacks on Hömberg, and the Redcap Victor rides into the southwestern streches of the Westerwald. Perhaps, he thinks to himself, it would be a good chance to partake of some hunting, by enjoying the hospitality of that local knight -- what was his name again? Sir Peter? His horse cautiously picks his way through a barely perceptible overgrown forest track... After some time, the rider stops with a frown. Wasn't that new village around about here? But he seems to be in dense forest, with no sign of civilisation... ah, except there! He spies the remains of what looks like an ancient wooden palisade, behind it a small rise. Victor dismounts and clambers over it, the flimsy and rotten remains crumbling away beneath him. Struggling through the undergrowth to the top of the mound, he finds some more wooden remains. It almost looks the manor house where he stayed little more than a year ago... But that surely cannot be -- these rotting wooden stumps are seemingly decades-old, overgrown and surrounded by mature trees.

The Redcap shakes his head as he makes his way back to his horse. Perhaps he had simply smoked too many faery herbs at Turrius Glorium again. No matter. On to Nummus Prosper.</text>

Downtime before the [[VT No. 5|next session]] will be from the Summer season 1229 to the Spring season 1231, inclusive. That's 8 seasons in total. ''KA-CHING!''

'''YOU MUST COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING BEFORE THE NEXT SESSION!!!'''

'''(Failure to comply may result in the loss of vis and/or seasons.)'''

== Adventure of your choice (optional) ==

You may spend one of your seasons doing some kind of adventuring (please describe briefly), for which you may take 10XP on appropriate Abilities and Arts (but not all on Arts!)

== Write Wiki-Story (optional) ==

Write a suitable story concerning any activity or event during the downtime, gain 5XP on relevant Abilities/Arts.

== Miscellaneous Activities (optional) ==

If you want to do anything else out of the ordinary in these 8 seasons, then either email me or otherwise add a page to the wiki or a section to your character, and I will respond accordingly... eventually!

== Vis ==

'''*** Reminder that vis tokens have lost their validity! ***'''

The sole true record of all vis owned by the covenant and by your character is [[Vis|here]].

Henceforth, all additions, trades, and expenditure of vis will be dealt with on this wiki. I will add the covenant vis, including vis harvested and vis expended on the Aegis of the Hearth.

'''If you do labwork (either personal or covenant work) requiring vis, please deduct the relevant amount from the relevant section, or if the relevant section does not yet exist, add a note.'''

I will be monitoring the history of the vis page closely. ;-)

== Covenant Work ==

Covenant work is one season every two years.

You thus have to do one season each in the current period of downtime. Any reasonably useful item, book, or Lab Text is likely to be approved as covenant work, and such approval may be assumed. It is likely you will have the vis for items, within reason.

If you create an item, add it to [[Items|this page]].

If you write a book or lab text, add it to [[Library|this page]].

We should also have a page keeping a record of all covenant work. [[Covenant work|Here]] is such a page. Add a complete record of all covenant work undertaken by your character. (I will fill in any gaps from my records.)

== Remaining Seasons ==

You may study from books, invent spells, enchant items, etc. as usual. If you invent a new spell or enchant an item please email me for approval. If reading books, please ask me for the Qualities (i.e. how many XP you gain). You can add a comment to the [[Library]] if you wish. 

Please update the list of [[seasonal activities]] with a brief summary. For things that you want/need to keep private, just write a vague summary such as &quot;Travel&quot; in place of &quot;spends a season joining the demonic cabal&quot; or &quot;Read book&quot; in place of &quot;study Infernal Lore&quot;, that sort of thing. :)

In the rare cases where you need to roll dice (study from vis, experimentation), we can do this at the start of the next session.

== Update Companions and Grogs ==

For 1229 and 1230, each gets a total of 4 seasons training/practice, and 4 seasons of Exposure. Let's not get into the nitty-gritty of who teaches what - you may assume a &quot;sensible&quot; programme of appropriate training. (Two entire years of Great Weapon or Carouse training are unlikely to be appropriate.)

In some cases, aging rolls may be necessary - we can do these at the start of the next session.

If the character sheet is unavailable (i.e. it's in my folder somewhere), you will have to do this at the start of the next session, but let's not waste any time on it!

== And finally... ==

If you've finished all this, give yourself a pat on the back, take a deep breath, and henceforth leave me the hell alone. :-)</text>

The library of [[Nummus Prosper Saga|Nummus Prosper]] is currently [[Media:Nummusprosper library.pdf|here]].

Please add any new additions to this page.

== Comments on books ==

Christoph writes: Just write all changes on this page, and I'll make a new pdf version for easier readability. Also, don't forget to write comments! Undine, your new books will henceforth be numbered, so no need to bother inventing names for them ;o) I am ''still'' missing the book comments from Relentus and Undine from VT4!

Root of the Art Herbam: A very detailed and precise description of the basic principles, yet of no value beyond the first study. Aphanius, Spring 1230.

== Recently purchased books ==

* Root of Herbam
* Root of Vim

* Beginner's Guide to Aquam

See [[Seasonal activities|here]] (entries in bold) for all covenant work performed.

According to the [[charter]], you have to do one season every two years. This means that by the end of 1226, each member should have performed at least three seasons of covenant work. A covenant meeting dropped one of the two-year requirements, so each member needs to do 5 seasons of covenant work up until 1232. The actual totals (at the end of 1231) are:

* Aphanius: 5 seasons
* Relentus: 5 seasons
* Undine: 6 seasons
* Vexator: 6 seasons

* ''Balderic: 1 season''

'''If anyone hasn't completed the &quot;downtime tasks&quot; by the next sessions, we'll just assume he'll do covenant work all of the seasons without grumbling!'''</text>

==Tribunal Business==

Given that the Tribunal's politics have devolved into gilds, there are only two major, overarching issues:

===The Grand Tribunal===

A major topic of discussion is the forthcoming [[Grand Tribunal]] in 1228. Firstly, the representatives of the Rhine Tribunal are chosen -- these are the usual big names; sadly there is very little chance that a journeyman would be considered for this role!

The major issue which the Rhine Tribunal -- or at least there is a clear majority of opinion supporting this view -- wishes to press is its territorial integrity. Furthermore, it wishes to secure claims over the lands of Denmark (Jutland and Zealand), which would be achieved by [[Heorot]]'s petition to formally join the Tribunal. There is the usual squabble over the eastern border, with the [[Novgorod Tribunal]], and the Rhine will seek a formal settlement of that border in their favour.

Apart from issues of territory, there is a general consensus that the votes of Rhine magi at the Grand Tribunal should be used to scupper the harebrained schemes of magi from the lesser Tribunals, which traditionally include nonsense such as: new Houses or new Tribunals, opening up of the Great Library, moving of the domus magni, changes to the Code to permit any mundane nonsense.

There is also a desire for the Grand Tribunal to address the issue of a (possible) grouping of hedge wizards in Norse lands, which some dub &quot;the Order of Odin&quot;. However, this is an issue which is mostly pressed only by [[Philippus Niger]] and the [[Ash Gild]].

===Rumours of a Split===

Sensational rumours of various types have spread like wildfire around the Tribunal gathering, and they concern the plans of the [[Apple Gild]] and the two covenants it dominates, [[Triamore]] and [[Oculus Septentrionalis]]. It seems that the Apple Gild magi have become so disillusioned at the Rhine Tribunal that they have come up with some great scheme. There is no single version of the rumour, but several reckon that, in league with some of the Normandy covenants, where there is also reported to be unrest, they plan to strike out on their own, creating a new Tribunal for themselves. This new Tribunal would be aligned with their philosophy.

Naturally, many Rhine magi view this prospect with horror! The [[Oak Gild]] considers such a split unthinkable, and does not want to see the ancient pre-emininence of the First Tribunal weakened. The Ash Gild fears that such a new Tribunal would be composed of quisling magi all to willing to bow before nobles and priests... and treat the Norse hedge wizards as their equals.

The Apple Gild itself keeps a very low profile and its magi publicly deny all such rumours... although these denials are somewhat equivocal. As such there is a conspiratorial tone -- more conspiratorial than usual, that is -- pervading the entire Tribunal gathering, and the Apple magi are viewed with considerable distrust. This doesn't help them with a number of ongoing matters, which mostly go against them: further censure against Triamore for mundane involvement, a ruling against Oculus Septentrionalis in their perennial squabble with [[Waddenzee]], censure against an Apple peregrinator which only just stops short of an outright March. The magi of Fengheld, however, seem strangely calm about the whole matter. Some speculate that, with both Oak magi and the co-leader of the Apple Gild among their numbers, they may be involved, or have some kind of advance information. Some of the Durenmar magi say that the Apple scheme would help to further Fengheld's interests, by weakening the traditional power of Bonisagus' covenant.

In any case, this is a matter which will be discussed at all the gild meetings. The Apple Gild meeting is lengthy and highly secretive, and has no announced time or location.

==Covenant Business==

===Establish Waldheim Chapter House===

Aphanius

* Officially establishes the chapter house at Waldheim. Watch closely for reactions, but defend the measure vigorously against accusations.

There are no major problems with this, although some eyebrows are raised at such a young covenant founding a chapter house so early. In the Rhine, this is considered precocious! Still, the leader of [[Nummus Prosper Saga|Nummus Prosper]] is a Fengheld protege, and given Fengheld's proliferation of chapter houses, there are no reasons to object. [[Simulacrum]] of [[Turris Glorium]] is quick to question whether the new chapter house contravenes the territorial agreement (concerning the &quot;division&quot; of the Westerwald) between the two covenants, but he is assured that this is not the case, and this is attested to by at least one Redcap. He then makes a theatrical show of &quot;welcoming the Nummus Proper magi closer to our home&quot;, which, reading between the lines, is interpreted as &quot;don't come any closer!&quot;

===Vis Trades===

Aphanius:

* Try to find someone interested in a Vis Trade: We offer Ignem or Mentem for Vim: 2 for 2 per year. There has to be someone interested in those ... and it really hurts spending Rego Vis for the Aegis, though I don't want to tell them that.

===Book Trades===

Aphanius:

* Try to find interested partners for a &quot;Tractati-Lease&quot;-program in the future, where we exchange Tractati from our respective libraries for a couple of seasons.

==Ash Gild Meeting==

Vexator:

* talk to the magi
* give demonic reliquiary to Philippus Niger (is this enough for a Master token, mayhap?)
* drop hints that Vexator is interested in Hoplite work, later on (still needs to &quot;beef up&quot;)
* also would like to ask about a nice introductory Summa on Infernal Lore (&quot;Look, but don't Touch Lore&quot;). The Ash Guild knows that this is only for defensive and scholary purposes, better not ask this in public tribunal

Aphanius:

*Gain allies for an eventual case about the removal of Hömberg.
*If there are other members needing assistance in some way, try to see if there can be a 'mutually beneficial' deal.
*In the no doubt upcoming discussion about the Apple Guild rumours, try to find out what the general attitude is and how specific members think about it.

==Vexator's Business==

Vexator will certainly go to the Tribunal. Main order of business is to find out how he can achieve his master title the most efficient way. 

===Master Title===

* need to ask (most) masters of what they would expect from Vexator, ignore any Merinita, Elder Guild masters etc. 
** Henri de Tours: offer to give him a full Rego tractati load for copying (first book he already got, second book Vexator took with him to the tribunal, next 2 books within this year)
** a master of the Ash guild (see below), perhaps offer to do an aggressive task (future story seed?)
** third person depends on who asks for what. Occultes? 
* aim is to do the deeds to get the master tokens by the next tribunal (1235)

===Longevity Ritual===

* looking for Cr and/or Co specialists, who are willing to make a [[Longevity Rituals|longevity ritual]], ask for price; possible favours to cut down vis costs?

After the Ash Gild meeting, Vexator asks Igor Rastvan about this. ''&quot;You wish to hire an archmage for your first Longevity Ritual?! A bit young are you not! Normally I would consider this a great insult, but one hears that you are quite the ambitious tyro, and as an upstanding member of the Ash Gild, doubtless you want only the best, and are willing to pay for it, yes? I may be able to spare a season for you for... oh, let's say, two Rooks. One rook of which to be vis tenta or Corpus. Of course, if this is too much for you, then I daresay my first filius could provide you with a respectable enchantment for a slightly lower price.&quot;''

Vexator also asks Relentus about the price from Verdi (see below).

Vexator meets with a Redcap from the Tribunal of the Greater Alps, Cymena. Amongst other things, she is acting as an emissary from the covenant of Sinews of Knowledge, famed for its expertise with Longevity Rituals. ''&quot;I would be happy to tell you more. Our maga most suited to the enchantment of Rituals for younger magi is Ragoneda, a member of your own fine House, in fact! She will charge you seven pawns of vis tenta, or ten of vis forma... what's that you say? You want the '''best'''? Well, doubtless you have heard of Hubert of Bonisagus. He will enchant you a most potent Ritual for twelve vis tenta -- or sixteen vis forma... oh, you mean the '''very best'''?! Gosh... well, I suppose you might be able to persuade Archmaga Philomena to spare you a season from her precious research, but it would cost you twelve vis tenta '''and''' eight vis forma. As you know, we are of course blessed to count the greatest living enchanter of Longevity Rituals, Archmage Paxon of House Verditius, amongst our numbers, but a mere young tyro such as yourself would never be able to secure his services! Even Primi and other Archmages strain to bend his ear... Anyway, I would be happy to arrange a master enchanter of your choosing.&quot;''

Vexator also reads in the Great Library about the famed covenant of Epidauros, in the Theban Tribunal, which supposedly produces Longevity Rituals of a legendary quality. He is unable to obtain precise information about cost, but arranges to send a letter. Asking at the Mercer House of Durenmar, he is told that an Arcane Connection to that covenant can be purchased for two pawns of vis, and will take about a year to arrive. ''If you wish to do this, please write so here, and deduct the [[vis]].''

===Cabal of the Flypaper===

* Attend, and see what happens. Check if Nummus Prosper is still on the &quot;Tabanus No-Go List&quot;. 

===Pranks===

* See if he can start some mischief with Simulacrum, or Tabanus :)
* Move his Corpus-Tractatus to the front of the Corpus section. Again. Sigh.

===Vis Trading===

* Looking for Vis trades, especially interested in &quot;mapping&quot; the vis in the tribunal: who needs what, who can offer what? 
* Overall goal is to increase the Technique and Form Vis: only trade &quot;favourably&quot;. This will also depend on what Vis my Longevity Ritual Magus is asking for, that Vis I will try to acquire.

(This is personal vis trading, not covenant vis trading, yes? [[User:Andrew|Andrew]] 21:31, 26 October 2009 (UTC))
: It is indeed. I'm looking to find the Vis necessary for my LR. [[User:Christoph|Christoph]] 22:14, 26 October 2009 (UTC)

==Aphanius' Business==

Aphanius will go to the tribunal.  This section is work in progress!

===Hermetic Politics===

Aphanius will closely monitor the tribunal cases and politics, especially where it concerns neighbours of Nummus Prosper. Main Goals are:
*Identify anything that might affect the covenant in the future, be it rulings or agendas.
*Watch the members of neighbouring covenants, to get an idea of their political motivations and ambitions.
*Should the case come up, he will vigorously defend the removal of Hömberg. Also, watch for similar cases to refer to.
*Try to find out if the area rumoured to split away contains or is close to Nummus Prosper.

Also, try to strengthen the position of Nummus Prosper:
*Seek out the Princeps of other Rhine covenants (except those from Dankmar and similar 'covenants') for some smalltalk in the evenings, to get an idea on their personality and make aquaintances.
*Seek out members of the Apple Guild (or likeminded magi), to see if they have special training programs/good books for improving the quality of covenant staff.

===House Tremere Meeting===

* Try not to repeat the embarrassing 24-hours-knockout from last meeting.

* Check on the status of the Cold Iron Vexillation: Who is a member? Who is in charge? What is being done? Also, tell of his encounter with the Wild Hunt and his Visit to the Court of Bright Winter.

* Inquire about conditions for Coeris Longevity Ritual.

His parens, Clemens, tells him: ''&quot;It is customary for junior Tremere magi, at least those who are not great Corpus experts in their own right, to travel to Coeris for their first Longevity Ritual. There, you will find one of the masters of our House who will be willing to provide for you. You will first have to offer him two seasons of your service, and then you will only need to provide the vis for the Ritual. Of course, should you happen to be flush with vis, you may be able to waive one or both seasons of service with a suitable payment! For such a magus, I would guess that five or six pawns per season waived would probably suffice.&quot;''

==Relentus' Business==

Relentus will (probably) go to the Tribunal. Amongst other things, he plans to enquire about the possibility of obtaining a Longevity Ritual at Verdi.

The usual Verditius price for enchanted items is twice the vis cost of enchantment, and that applies to Longevity Rituals as well. (This does not include the vis needed for the enchantment.) So, a good-quality Ritual suitable for magus of 30 years of age, needing six pawns, would cost 12 pawns. A Ritual potent enough for a magus of 50 years costs 20 pawns. However, this formula starts to break down at the high end! Rumour tells that the great Archmage Paxon of House Verditius (at Sinews of Knowledge) has at times charged 40 or more pawns... Some say that he is now so rich, that he no longer seeks his payment in vis -- almost unthinkable, for a Verditius!</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1012">'''Name?'''
4 CrIg Items to give &quot;Magical Superiour Lighting&quot; to every magus, created by Relentus. ''(Details?)''

:: Since Relentus is Volker's character, we're never going to see stats for it on the wiki. I think it was a Cr(Re)Ig effect, either 20 or 25. 

'''Helmet of the Hunter of Hermes''' (InVi 24)

''T:Ind, R:Touch, D:Sun, constant effect''

A simple iron helmet with a leather strap to fix it on the chin. Its wearer can see any item containing Vis shimmering with an inner light, making raw Vis easy to identify. This effect has a penetration of 0.

''(Base 1, +4 Vision, +2 Sun, +1 Touch, +4 constant effect)''

This item is used by Emelric to find Vis in the Westerwald. He is usually out for a few days before returning with any findings or hunted game. Aphanius takes care to always have an arcane connection to the Grog at hand in Waldheim.

'''Hand of Poseidon'''

A (Re Aq) device that may remotely prevent bigger ships to pass Pfalz Island. Exact stats yet to be determined.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4108">Most magi in the [[Rhine Tribunal]] try to obtain their first Longevity Ritual about 10-15 years after their Gauntlet, while they still have the status of tyro (journeyman). There are a variety of possibilities:

* A minority of magi craft a Longevity Ritual for themselves. (These are usually those with a talent for Creo and/or Corpus.)
* Some young magi follow the tradition of seeking out their parens for their first Longevity Ritual. (If they enjoy good relations and the master is suitably skilled, that is.)
* Some seek out an elder magus from within their own gild.
* Some seek out some other Rhine magus who they believe to be an expert in Creo and/or Corpus.
* Some seek out a magus in another Tribunal.
* Most Redcaps will sooner or later be provided with a Longevity Ritual crafted by a Mercere or Verditius magus.

The Rhine Tribunal is not unfortunately not currently blessed with any magi or covenants known to have a great focus or expertise with longevity. Still, there are some possibilities:

* The magi of [[Dankmar]] are believed to be capable of creating potent Longevity Rituals -- or at least it has been noted how they have been able to produce daughters at an advanced age. However due to their seclusion and generally poor reputation, almost no-one seeks them out for help.
* Igor Rastvan of [[Roznov]] is known as a master of Corpus and has a splendid lab which is highly suitable. However he is a proud and rich man, and so surely he would not deign to offer his service to a mere journeyman unless the price was very high.
* Petrus Virilis of [[Durenmar]] is rumoured to know something about fertility magics, or at least his former mistress was famed as an expert in Creo and Corpus, plus he has fathered several Gifted children. He is too young to have great expertise, but he could probably craft a passable Longevity Ritual?
* There are probably one or two magi at [[Fengheld]] who are skilled enough to produce a standard Longevity Ritual for a fair price.

Given the relative lack of expertise in the Tribunal, it is not altogether uncommon for magi to travel to other Tribunals to seek out a longevity expert. Possibilities include:

* Sinews of Knowledge in the Greater Alps Tribunal is renowned as a Bonisagus research covenant with a great expertise in longevity. It is close to the Rhine Tribunal, being just south of the River Danube, and the two Tribunals have generally good relations. The covenant also has close relations with Durenmar. Several Rhine magi have Longevity Rituals created here.
* Some magi from Requies Aeterna in the Normandy Tribunal used to be skilled with longevity as well as banishing the undead, although if recent news is to be believed, the covenant is in a state of decline.
* There are likely one or two longevity specialists of House Verditius at their domus magna, Verdi, in the Roman Tribunal.
* The covenant of Epidauros in the far-flung Theban Tribunal supposedly produces Longevity Rituals of a legendary quality, or so the Redcaps say.
* Coeris, or some other covenant in the Transylvanian Tribunal, is presumed to be home to some longevity experts, because several Rhine Tremere magi travel there to obtain one, and most of the Rhine Tremere are believed to have powerful Longevity Rituals.

== Vexator's Longevity Ritual ==

After consulting with the redcaps and other magi, Vexator counts his options. He's like a truly excellent potion, price is only of secondary importance. He'll send letters via redcaps and also talk to the magi of the tribunal during the Tribunal: 

* Older magus of the guild: Igor Rastvan. Butter him up, brown-nosing, etc. Let's see what he demands! 
* Epidaurus: If they're ''that'' good, ask for the price and how long it would take to get there. 
* Sinews of Knowledge: ask for an excellent LR there.
* Verdi: ask for the price of an excellent LR there.

== Aphanius' Longevity Ritual ==

Aphanius still has some years left before he needs a Longevity Ritual, but since planning never hurts, he will enquire at the House Tremere Meeting what the price tag of a Coeris Ritual is.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="784">Günther is the personal shield grog of [[Aphanius]]. Trained in [[Fengheld]], he accompanies the young magus since he left the covenant. Günther is not the brightest of fellows, but that rarely matters - Aphanius only demands unquestioning obedience and loyalty. Günther has proven himself a capable swordsman, but is frequently overstrained with the protection of his master, who is prone to exposing himself to dangers. This has already resulted in Aphanius suffering a number of serious wounds, though he has never blamed Günther for this.

Günther is now stationed in Waldheim, where he stands guard at the door to Aphanius' laboratory (and living) building, keeping out non-hermetic visitors and emphasising his masters claim of authority over the village.

[[Aphanius]] sets out as soon as he finds the time. He will take Günther with him, as well as his usual equipment (i.e., his sword and robes), except for replacing his usual iron tiara by one made of ice. On the morning, before leaving for the court, he casts another spontaneous CrIg spell for the day to illuminate himself (just like he did in Hömberg). He then casts his 'Piercing the Faerie Veil' and 'Aura of Enobled Presence' and heads into the forest, leading the way for [[Günther]].

It is (appropriately) a bright winter day as Aphanius and Günther set out, a few light sprinkles of snow occasionally drifting down between the trees of the Westerwald. The two set out on the vague path from Waldheim, and walk for a couple of hours through the silent forest. By following the correct correspondences (uphill, light, snow, cold) as well as his instincts and his magics, Aphanius is able to get close to where he believes the faerie regio to be, although to Günther it seems to be a rather rambling, irrational walk.

Eventually, they arrive at a clearing where bright sunshine plays off fresh, deep snowdrifts. On the far side, two giant figures block a path deeper into the forest. Aphanius recognises the threshold to the regio and the outer entrance to the [[Court of Bright Winter]], and approaches. The two guardians are snowmen, eight foot tall, with berries for eyes and carrot noses, wielding spears of a pale wood. As before, one of them speaks, with a deep wintry voice, ''&quot;In order to proceed, you must pass a test. A challenge of endurance, of wisdom, or of the hunt. Which is your choice?&quot;'' Aphanius answers that he wishes a test of wisdom. The other snowman then speaks, ''&quot;The part of the bird that is not in the sky, which can swim in the ocean and always stay dry. What am I?&quot;''

Aphanius ponders for some moments, then replies: ''&quot;You are the shadow.&quot;''

The impassive guardians stand to either side, to allow the magus and his grog to enter the path. They pass through a dense stretch of trees, calm but blanketed with snow, and ascend a slight rise to the small hill at the centre of the court.

The two travellers arrive at the clearing atop the hillock. It is bright, althought the light is diffuse, and snow is all around, in places with some white lilies poking through. Across the clearing, at the highest point, is a rockface with what appears to be a large window of ice or glass, fringed with icicles. Some of the snowflakes which drift lazily around the court, seemingly with a mind of their own, periodically peel off from the pane or reattach themselves to it. Behind it, the court's presumed ruler is seated. She is a pale and beautiful young woman, slender, with long dark hair, bearing a serene expression. She wears a pale gown and a coronet of ice. A host of other faeries are assembled around the court: a man with the head and wings of an owl, a hunter with a ferret's head and horse's hooves in a dark cloak carrying a pale bow, a peaceful grey bear wearing leather armour in whose lap a todder plays, other smaller beings. A number of wolves lie docile around the edge of the clearing.

The gentle sounds of the court quieten further as Aphanius approaches, and numerous curious heads of various types turn in his direction. The small owlish man steps forward -- Aphanius remembers that he seemed to be the spokesman or steward of the court; he is dressed in a tunic and carries an ornate staff. Appraising the guest briefly, he bows deeply and gracefully, his owl wings tucking behind him. ''&quot;Welcome again, noble guest,&quot;'' he addresses Aphanius, ignoring Günther, ''&quot;To what does the Lady owe this unexpected pleasure?&quot;''

Aphanius also bows politely before the faerie steward. ''&quot;I would not think my visit is entirely unexpected. After all, the Lady requested my assistance in a matter, and I helped out. You will certainly have noted the settlement of Hömberg is no longer an issue. I have already taken steps so it will not become one again.&quot;''
Aphanius stands even more upright, his face resolved. His voice is calm, polite yet determined.
''&quot;However, I must remind her Lady with all due respect that I am not a member of her court. I am a free man of free will, and as such I did not do as she commanded but as she wished. I fought for her, twice, in battles which might very well have cost me dearly. I therefore have the right to ask for something in return.&quot;''
Aphanius makes a small pause and casts his gaze over the assembled court, making sure to meet everyones eye should they be looking at him. The message is clear: He does not intend to back down.
''&quot;I have come to claim that right.&quot;''

There is a long moment of silence throughout the court, interrupted by a faint chilly breeze which blows several snowflakes across the scene. Some of the lesser faeries stir a bit uncomfortably, but the Lady seems impassive, as always.

The steward steps forward again, cautiously. He coughs delicately before speaking. ''&quot;Your assistance was most welcome, valiant guest. The Lady however notes that you continue to enjoy the hospitality of her domain... What exactly did you seek by way of reward?&quot;''

Aphanius replies without hesitating, his eyes fixed on the lady beyond the ice, his expression one of adoration and desire. ''&quot;I have but one desire: A curl of hair from the most beautiful maiden in the forest, so I can carry a memory of her into future battles. As custom commands, I will continue to fight for her as long as I reside in her domain.&quot;''
His voice becomes firmer and louder, as if he was challenging some invisible invader.
''&quot;Yet I shall fight with the strength of ten men and never despair if I carry a token of her into battle!&quot;''
He pauses for a moment, gaze cast into the distance beyond the ice, as if lost in a dream. The snowflakes drifting through the court settle on his skin, but they do not melt. Then his eyes slowly focus back onto the court. He speaks as if waking up from slumber.
''&quot;That is all I seek.&quot;''

The court responds with a faint hubbub of hushed voices and animal noises, some of them sounding either shocked or impressed. There is a minor snow flurry again, which settles down into a long moment of absolute silence.

The owl-man, slightly wide-eyed, purses his lips. ''&quot;You certainly make a bold request, noble knight.&quot;'' There follows another moment of silence. Again, the figure of the maiden behind the ice window does not react... or was that the faintest tilting of her head that Aphanius noticed?

The steward clears his throat and speaks again, as if making an official annoucement. ''&quot;The Maid of Frozen Dew will agree to your request and honour your pledge of service... if you can prove yourself a worthy suitor, that is. You have already proved your valour, now you must prove your wits!&quot;'' He gestures somewhat theatrically to the faerie ruler. ''&quot;The Lady says that you may have your prize, if you can claim it in person!&quot;'' The court responds with some oohs and aahs -- clearly they are now becoming excited by this challenge. The steward bows again and steps back gracefully, seeming to indicate that Aphanius should simply step forward to the Lady. But obviously it can't be that simple... and there is the strange pane of... ice? in the way.

In the meantime, Aphanius has noticed that the pane of ice coincides with a regio boundary... As the magus ponders, with the audience in expectant mood, the steward steps forward once more, rummaging in a pouch. He withdraws something and offers it to the magus. ''&quot;Ah! Perhaps you were waiting for this!&quot;'' He hands over a delicate pair of silver scissors. There is some laughter among the court in response, which subsides again into silence.

Aphanius nods thankfully when handed the scissors. ''&quot;Indeed, that's what I was waiting for. As you have said, my sword is certainly not the right tool for such a delicate task.&quot;'' He pockets the scissors and then he lets his gaze wander around the court, walking around as if looking for something. He is looking for further regio boundaries, but stops every so often to catch one of the drifting snowflakes with his hand, examine it for a moment, and then let it go as if it was not what he was looking for.

The large snowflakes do not melt in his hand. They seem to have a mind of their own, blowing around where they want. It almost seems as if they return to the pane of the ice or glass when they are about to melt, to replenish themselves. The rough rocky outcropping on top of the hill is about the size of a large house. The cave and window of ice appear to be at its front, facing onto the clearing and the Court. From his spell, Aphanius can tell that the innermost regio level roughly coincides with this highest rocky region. He approaches the cave more closely and begins a walk around the Court...

The assemblage of faeries parts to allow him to explore. The ferret-headed hunter looks at him watchfully, as if to warn him from any mischief. The toddler in the lap of the great bear stares at him goggle-eyed, as if he is the first human he has ever seen. It looks like it is possible to walk to either side of the rocky hilltop, but at the rear it looks too overgrown and steep to navigate easily... Moving around to the left-hand side, the clearing between the rockface and the slope away from the Court is narrower. It looks like there is some kind of narrow cave entrance -- inside it is dark and laden with ice and snow and does not appear to be a regio boundary, at least not immediately. A great white wolf lies blocking the entrance and watches him closely.

Finally, Aphanius catches a snow flake that has a rough, thorny pattern on the periphery, but a smooth, rolling pattern at the center. He makes a small delighted sound and heads towards the icy window, as if he has found what he was looking for and intends to now claim his prize. He kneels down, the snowflake still in his hand, and looks at the lady, though he avoids eye contact.

''&quot;My liege, most beautiful lady in the forest. I know that my station is far below yours, yet I cannot withhold the passion burning inside me. I know I will never be your equal, and I do not ask you to accept me. I only ask a small gift, something to remind me of you while away.&quot;''
He pauses briefly, holding the snowflake higher.
''&quot;Think of me as this snowflake, not bound by oath but by its own will to drift close to you. Its outside is warlike, just as I will continue to fight for you. It is rough, just as I will never betray my feelings for you after the sun sets today, for they are unbecoming. And it is cold, just like I will be on the outside, showing no compassion for those who have no honour.&quot;''
He briefly pauses again.
''&quot;Though on the inside, it is beautiful and enchanting, just like I will always think of you. It is bright in the light of the sun, just as I shall carry your blessing with pride. And it is cold, just like I will be for knowing I can not have what I desire most.&quot;''
His eyes finally shift to meet hers.
''&quot;I blow you this snowflake as the closest I will ever come to a kiss from you. Like this snowflake I would fade if not for your blessing. Please grant me my humble request.&quot;''
And with that, he raises the snowflake close to his lips - yet not touching them - and blows it towards the lady.

Aphanius' speech is met with a respectful silence, after which there are some sounds of appreciation and admiration. The snowflake drifts forward gently, bobbing to and fro, and makes its way to the pane of ice -- through which the impassive Lady still stares at the magus -- and kisses the window, melding on to it and dissappearing. For a brief moment, nothing happens. Then the lady raises one hand slowly. From the interior of the ice pane, a snowflake -- possibly somehow the same one -- detachs and drifts towards her. The window is slightly opaque, so it is difficult to make out all the details, but it seems to bob towards her head, which she tilts slightly. The snowflake attachs to her cheek and, slowly, melts. There are some gasps of astonishment and amazement around the Court. It is difficult to tell, but perhaps, just perhaps, the Lady's expression has assumed a slightly wistful or melancholic hue?

In any case, it seems that the magus' gesture is well-received, although there is no further assistance forthcoming towards his objective... or at least no obvious aid. He seems to have hit the right note of style, but he still has to somehow get into the cave.

Aphanius rises, a smile hidden on his face. ''&quot;Thank you, my lady, for accepting my gift.&quot;'' He bows deeply and then proceeds towards the narrow path. His pace is slow, yet determined. He fixes his eyes on the big wolf, catching its gaze. Thus he approaches to within a foot. Then he kneels down, slowly extending his hand to stroke the beast's snout.

The great wolf seems remarkably peaceable right now, and does not seem to object to Aphanius' attentions. The beast does not protest as Aphanius cautiously steps over it to enter the dark, icy tunnel ahead of him...

The narrow passageway has rough-hewn stone walls, and packed ice and snow covers its floor. In places icicles and stalactites extend from the ceiling. It is not completely dark; there is a faint eerie blue phosphoresence from somewhere, in places slightly brighter, at other junctures barely more than black. Patches of mist lurk in some of the tunnels and the air is mostly still, but occasionally the faint echoes of howling winter winds can be heard.

The first tunnel proceeds gradually downwards, before branching. It quickly becomes clear that this underground domain is much larger than the rocky outcropping appeared to be from the outside... there is a veritable labyrinth down here! Aphanius notices passing through a regio boundary. He walks on in the gloom, sometimes struggling against the slope, the icy floor, or a narrow pass... It would be very easy to get lost in here, he cautions himself, but fortunately the young Tremere has his Intellego Vim magics to guide him. He idly wonders where else the tunnels might lead to...

Eventually, after what seems like an hour or more, he passes yet another regio boundary and ascends a straight stairway that appears to have been crafted by mortal hands. At the top, it is lighter... He emerges into the chamber of the Maid of Frozen Dew. She sits there, serene as always, watching him approach. Behind the slightly opaque window of ice, one can now see out into the Court. It is silent from here, but if he could perceive any sounds from the outside assemblage, he would have heard gasps of amazement. The Lady inclines her head ever so slightly as Aphanius approaches. He takes a deep breath and bows gracefully before approaching carefully, taking care not to touch the faerie ruler. Withdrawing the delicate silver scissors, he slowly snips off a small lock of her jet-black hair and pockets it, bowing again. Aphanius has his prize.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1262">With the procurement of my [[On the perfect Longevity Ritual|Longevity Ritual]] getting closer, I need to think about the future. The Ritual will leave me sterile, so I can no longer enrich the world with further Vexators. While I am not particularly keen to settle down, I must admit that the thought of living for hundreds of years without the opportunity to watch and encourage my totally charming and pleasant offspring is depressing. I believe I have read a Tractatus by some Bonisagus bloke, who called this behaviour &quot;articulus media vita&quot;. Anyway, I am an accomplished magus, so I can make plans to prevent this. I will simply look in the general vicinity of our Covenant for suitable mothers: fair, cute, active, and smart girls of my age or younger. I can and will then use several possible ways to father some children with these: Corpus or Mentem magics, my natural charm, disguises, many possibilities. Once I then have three to six children on their way, I can take my Longevity Ritual. That leaves me two or three years to complete this task. Shouldn't be too much of a problem. The mothers then can live at our covenant, where a modest pension will be handed to them. I will talk to [[Albrecht]] and leave the specifics to him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3912">Initial observations have uncovered at least three more organized courts of fae in the vicinity of Nummus Prosper.

The [[Court of Bright Winter]] claims the Forest in which Waldheim, our chapter house containing my laboratory, is situated. It is apparently lead by the &quot;Maid of Frozen Dew&quot;, a Fae appearing as a beautiful young women contained in a cave sealed off by solid ice. Obvious defenses of the court include faerie bears. Admittance requires the passing of a test, which has not proven to be a problem. They appear to be quite set on their claim of this forest, mentioning that I reside here on their grace. They insist on a removal of Hömberg. I have decided to play along with their fancies for the time being, striking when the moment is opportune.

The [[Court of Dark Summer]] is very much the opposing court, a traditional arrangement based on contrasting seasons. It has two major faeries, a dark crone and a beautiful woman. Together with the maid of frozen dew, that completes the traditional set of maid, mother and crone, leaving little space for other seasonal courts. I therefore conclude that with high probability there is no Autumn or Spring court. The Fae of this court are rude and darker than the winter court, another typical faerie contrast. They might have some link to the Schönburg familiy, but I did not yet have time to investigate this.

Thirdly, a number of Fae are connected to the annual wine festival in the village upwards of Kaub, our Muto Vis source. They seem to draw vitality from the celebrations. We have not yet established how exactly this works - more wine has not resulted in more vis, though more women for more celebration did. Little is known about these Fae. I would have initially suspected they belong to the Autumn court, but I do not currently believe such a court exists. I shall try to find out more at future festivals, though I have to proceed with caution so as not to endanger our Vis source.

I have met the wild hunt. The encounter was neither entirely pleasant nor very successful from my perspective. They are headed by a dark figure clad in black armor, wielding an icy blade. They were out to destroy Hömberg. I stopped them, though how I do not entirely know.

I challenged them to a duel, hoping to face one of the riders whom I was confident I could best. I faced their leader. It was rather short, and the first thing I remember after being hit by his icy blade is waking up in the church. Nevertheless, the attack has been mostly a good thing: The villagers are more convinced to leave then ever, and they don't seem keen on returning. I was able to analyze the behaviour of what certainly is a powerful force amongst the local fae, and prove that I will not bow before them.

I have a scar from the magic of the hunt that might prove very useful: I am no longer disturbed by cold, nor does snow seem to melt on my skin. I have not yet established how this relates to the blade that struck me.

Nevertheless, I have added them to my grimoire of local faeries. They seem to know of the court of Bright Winter, possibly they are even at the command of the lady. If that is the case, I shall be twice as careful in my future dealings with the court.

Oh, and Huntsman. We have not met the last time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13395">In the summer of 1228, [[Aphanius]] and [[Günther]] set out from Waldheim to travel west. They cross Pfalz Island, where they stay for a night, and then head further west on the next morning. Aphanius seems somewhat grumpy and distracted - he's simply not used to being up at daytime.

Once they reach the approximate area of the [[Court of Dark Summer]], Aphanius will cast a spontaneous Perdo Ignem spell (Sun Duration) to cast himself into shadow, as well as his Piercing the Faerie Veil and Intuition of the Forest (the latter on both of them). So equipped, they start their search for the regio.

They seem to gradually find their way into the lowest, darkest part of the forest. It is a humid and sweaty night, and numerous flies bother the two travellers. Aphanius' spells tell him that he should make an abrupt turn by a blackened oak.

As they discover the way leading into the regio, Aphanius turns toward Günther: ''&quot;It is essential that I show strength and solve the test myself. You will stand back until I signal you or go to the ground. Understood?&quot;''

Günther raises an eyebrow, but nods.

Aphanius spontaneously casts a Wizard's Sidestep, then they enter the first regio, crossing a dark clearing where the sky is spectacularly clear and full of stars.

They head towards the two guardians at the far side of the clearing, and Aphanius steps forth. They seem to be two seven-foot-tall scarecrows, with pumpkins for heads, wielding large agricultural implements as weapons. Inside each of the hollow pumpkin heads seem to be two dancing eyes of light.
 
''&quot;My name is Aphanius, Knight Errant. I wish to enter the Court of Dark Summer. State your challenge.&quot;''

The two faerie guardians cross their weapons to bar the path. One speaks with a hollow, crackling fire-like voice. ''&quot;You may attempt a contest of skill, a contest of fighting prowess, or a contest of luck. State your choice.&quot;''

Aphanius draws his sword. ''&quot;I choose the test of arms.&quot;'' He then casts his Perdo Vim Spell. After the first casting, the great scarecrow recoils with a hiss, as if a fire had been doused with water. However it stands yet, and advances jerkily, striking at the illusory magus. The young Tremere hastily repeats his casting. This time, the faerie falls to the ground with a thud. The hovering flames exit the lifeless pumpkin head and fly off towards the centre of the regio.

Not paying any attention to the body, Aphanius enters the court, sheathing his sword and dispelling his sidestep.

The centre of the regio is a dark clump of forest with a narrow path leading into it. Aphanius first arrives at the Fountain of Flaming Flowers. Tall blooms, red and purple, surround a group of pools, which seem to be made of liquid light. Every now and again, a small fountain of flame or light erupts, spraying a small dose of witchfires into the air. The witchfires seem to be small points of light, akin to candle flames, that slowly fly and bob around. Sometimes they visit the flowers, and sometimes they re-enter the pool.

Seated on a rock overlooking the pools is a graceful lady of indeterminate age, with red hair and starry eyes, dressed in something between a hunter's and a noblewoman's attire. The Dame of the Flowers stares contemplatively (perhaps with melancholy?) into the pools, and only looks up briefly as the Tremere arrives, paying him little heed.

Further into the court, its ruler, the Crone of the Brazier, stands haggardly, stirring a cauldron in the middle of a large plum-coloured fire. She is an ancient and withered woman, dressed in a shawl. More of the witchfires are here (this seems to be the nexus of their activity), entering and leaving the fire, and dancing around the cauldron and the Crone. The heat radiating from the fire's glowing coals is quite intense and uncomfortable. The old faerie seems to notice the new arrival, but at first does not speak, still endlessly stirring her cauldron.

Aphanius proceeds into the centre of the court, gesturing his shield grog to stay one step behind him. He courteously nods to the Crone of the Brazier, but does not speak. Instead, he glances around, looking for suitable fey to take to his laboratory. Günther gives his master a questioning look, but something tells him that he should stay quiet, too. So the pair stands there, waiting for the Crone to speak.

It is a long, uncomfortable silence. The Crone glances at Aphanius a couple of times, with piercing, ageless eyes, but says nothing. At long last, perhaps after half an hour or more, she speaks with a throaty and ancient voice, staring into the cauldron which she still stirs. ''&quot;For a Knight Errant, your Manners seem to be lacking.&quot;'' Her words hang in the air with a slight hint of menace.

Aphanius just smiles at her words and finally bows. ''&quot;I was thinking gold a suitable gift to a queen,&quot;'' he says, ''&quot;but if you wish me to talk, so be it.&quot;'' The Crone responds with the merest hint of a smile, ''&quot;You are wise, Master Knight, silence is golden.&quot;''

Aphanius stands upright, his right hand resting on his sword hilt, the left making a wide inviting gesture as he talks. ''&quot;I am on a quest to prove my worth as a Knight Errant. I have already met two of my goals, [[Aphanius visits the Court of Bright Winter|winning]] the favour of a beautiful maiden and [[Aphanius' Talisman|crafting]] a lance to carry in battle. My last is to gain a squire, and I have come to propose a bargain.&quot;''

He pauses for a moment, trying to lock his eyes on those of the Crone. ''&quot;I will serve at your court until my eyes catch sight of Sirius seven times. Afterwards, I shall take a number of servants from your court until their eyes catch sight of Sirius seven times. I shall take any that follow me willingly, yet their number shall be at least the number of tasks you ask of me and at most the number of days I served you.&quot;''

Aphanius can't stop himself from drawing a deep breath after he has spoken. Alea iacta est, to quote some famous guy from Rome. He stood there, forcing himself to appear calm, meeting the Crone's gaze with only the slightest hint of flinching. Voluntas vincit omnia, he repeated silently, the will conquers all. Discipline and training will previal. Yet on that night in the strange court, opposite the powerful faerie, he was not entirely convinced of that.

The brows of the ever-stirring faerie crone furrow momentarily, and she stares intently at the Tremere. ''&quot;But should the number of servants you take exceed the number of days you have served me, you will owe me one season of service for each unjustly taken servant. Do you agree?&quot;''

Aphanius ponders for a moment, then spots the trap in the Crone's words. He ponders for a few more moments, then offers a compromise. ''&quot;I agree, provided I am allowed to take less servants than the number of your tasks should I choose so.&quot;''

This time the Crone smiles slightly more obviously, with a hint of menace. ''&quot;Very good. It is agreed. I will expect that a Knight keeps to his Word.&quot;'' She sniffs at the sultry night air, ever stirring the cauldron. ''&quot;You may begin by fetching fuel for my fire. And when you have done that, you may set about repairing my hut. And after that, you may scrub all my tools until they gleam. And after that, you may craft me a new shawl, from that which you find in the nearby forest.&quot;''

Aphanius sets about the task without haste or delay, instead focusing on doing his work thoroughly. He uses spontaneous magic for the more demeaning tasks like cleaning the tools, and manual labour for repairs of the hut and the crafting of the shawl (though he is not beyond some Rego magic to support him). He sets Günther to gather food and search suitable shelter, and to keep his collection of nuts, one for each time they sleep so he can keep track of the days in the weird regio. Aphanius insists that Günther not take part in his tasks, so the Grog has some free time on his hands.

It is around his work on the shawl that something stirs in the magus' mind ... was the Crone referring to &quot;days&quot; as actual daytime? Then he would owe no small amount of service! But the Crone was also referring to &quot;seasons&quot;, and as a season is composed of all the days between two stellar constellations, he would owe no service at all no matter how many fey he took, if she were to insist on her definition. So the last remaining problem was that she could give him very little tasks, and claim only on the days where he worked on the tasks he had actually &quot;served&quot; ... so, about to finish the shawl, he starts taking his time if no further tasks are laid on him, ensuring that the number of days he actually works is at least the number of fey he wishes to take at the end of the season ...

Later, Aphanius retreats somewhat from the centre of the Court to explore. In one place, he notices some larger blobs of fiery light bobbing in the sweaty night air. Getting closer, they seem to be some kind of large moths, but with luminescent red bodies, like fireflies. Some of them seem to be playing or flying aimlessly, or chasing the smaller witchfires, but the majority have occupied themselves industriously. They seem to be gathering twigs and other debris from the forest, and taking them to a hollow tree stump, inside which they seem to have built some kind of dwelling or nest. Where slightly larger objects, such as a small stone or a piece of bone, have to be moved, several of the moths gather together to carry it.

Aphanius stands by and watches the fey for some time, then he concentrates and calls up his magic. Suddenly, a dozen small lights, flickering excitedly in a red colour, emerge from his hands and starts flying among the fey. They chase after some and let themselves be chased by others. Sometimes they split up to confuse their pursuers, or fuse together into a bigger ball shining in a more threatening red, only to burst apart again and fly into different directions. Aphanius just stands there, concentrating. Whenever one of the lights is finally caught, it vanishes in a flash of red. It takes the small fey a lot of concerted effort to chase down the last of the lights, but after some 40 minutes, the last one is extinguished as two excited faeries close on it from opposing sides. Aphanius then stoops to pick up a small nut that has fallen from a nearby tree, again working his magic to make it shine like a candle, then presenting it to the gathered fey as a present for their dwelling.

The Tremere magus thus begins to befriend the faerie moths, or so it seems. They remain wary of him, but don't seem to object to his assistance.

During the first four nights, Aphanius does nothing of note, fulfilling his tasks and entertaining the fey he intends to take in his free time. He tries to find out if they are receptive to music, if they are able to understand speech, or if there are other ways to communicate with them - he especially tries light in different colours to indicate different moods. Every evening, he glances at the night sky to make out Sirius.

The moths seem to be semi-intelligent. They respond to some kinds of music, to others not. They do not seem to understand speech to any great extent. Nevertheless, Aphanius begins to develop some kind of understanding and basic communication with them...

Of course, Aphanius (and Günther) quickly begin to become hungry, and thirsty. (I assume they feed themselves from that which they find nearby? Some forest creatures -- rabbits and the like -- could be caught, plus mushrooms and berries can be found. Still, all of it tastes pretty foul, on the verge of being rotten or decayed, but can be downed with difficulty, and provides nourishment.)

On the fifth night, the magus takes care not to glance at the sky, going to bed early and wrapping a blanket around his head so he does not catch sight of the star. He proceeds to do so during the next few nights.

Aphanius quickly begins to lose track of the days, because there do not seem to be any days as such. The stars turn in the heavens, more or less as usual, but dawn never seems to come. Whenever he goes to his makeshift bed or wakes, it is night. The &quot;days&quot; can be judged by the number of times that one sleeps and eats, although the seasonal movements of the stars seem to indicate that the season is already nearly halfway through, which is reinforced by the amount of nuts Günther has in his backpack.

Aphanius was sitting near the nest of the fey he had tried so hard to impress during the last few weeks. At least they were accepting his presence now, and it seemed they started to understand each other. He gazed at the star, then down to the parchment which held the calculations he had done at his lab. Ten days, if his calculations were right, were all that was left of the season. Then Sirius would vanish beyond the horizon, only to reappear next summer. It was time to set his plan into motion.

For two days, Aphanius will (try to?) watch Sirius appear above the horizon again, bringing his required length of service down to one day. Günther has rarely seen his master so nervous, for there is a small fear within the Tremere that he will lose this duel of wits, condemning him to stay at least two more seasons at the court before he can head home. Voluntas vincit omnia, he can often be heared muttering in the evening, as a reassurance to himself.

      <comment>puh, fertig, aber nicht gegengelesen, also sicher voller Fehler</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5882">An important matter has arisen aprubtly, prompting me to delay the use of my new laboratory equipment to handle the issue. It seems some hapless Flambeau filius got himself lost in Cologne, and now none less than the great Philipus Niger has requested our aid in the matter. Since Cologne is in the newly founded Lotharingian so-called-Tribunal, it would be handy to uncover some evidence of the no doubt widespread contravention of the peripheral code the apple guild is certainly perpetrating in this would-be-Tribunal.

As my esteemed colleague Relentus is probably a bit misplaced in the largest city the holy empire has to offer, we will depart as a group of 3 magi, namely my esteemed colleagues Undine and Vexator, myself, our faithful shieldgrogs, Hademar for some heavy duty persuasion, and Simon to dispense of all those bothersome daily troubles a journey brings. There are rumours of the involvement of some hedge magicians, but i am confident that no outside force can stand against the Order's magic. We shall return soon and successfully.

We have returned. Due to the unfortunate fact that I can not (yet) be at several places at once there were some bothersome cases of incompetence, but as a whole the expedition was succesful. The filius has been returned into the safe lap of the order, another infernalist slain and Philipus Niger seems not to upset about everything. Maybe because we did not tell him to much about the horse-and-carriage-chase through Cologne, or the rather unfortunate burning of a larger river vessel during a breakout attempt of said filius, mercifully cut short by Undine. But I shall stop this confused scribblings and recount our experiences chronologically.

We arrived in Cologne to find that it was not - as expected - a bit larger than Waldheim or even Kaub, but several orders of magnitude larger. Finding the tavern that was recommended proved to be a rather lengthy experience, where I had to step in personally after several failed attempts. At Night, we left the town again, as my esteemed colleague Vexator seemed either to timid or simply uncapable of performing his Intellego Corpus spell in a divine aura. Some of the grogs were already showing signs of sleepiness when we finally returned, having found that the young boy was being transported around. It seems our enemies had anticipated Intellego magics, which indicated the involvement of some soon-to-be-deceased hedge wizard.

In the morning, where no sane person goes about anywork and I thus rested for an afternoon of chasing a boy through streets, the other magi set out without me. Their reports were very confuse, but it seemed that my esteemed colleague Vexator finally got over himself and dared to use magic in the town itself, allowing them to track the boy despite the shortcomings of Undines magic. They finally caught up with him, and here is were things get confused. If my esteemed colleague Undine and Hademar are correct, my esteemed colleague Vexator teleported himself into the room where the boy was being held, without even preparing his magical defenses. This behaviour seems so utterly unlike him the overcautios Tytalus that I can scarcely belief it. Nonetheless, it seems he held the enemies at bay until Hademar and my esteemed colleague Undine arrived by mundane means.

Then there appears to have been a fight, which seems plausible enough in the face of Hademar's wounds. In this fight, they caught both the infernal Hedge Wizard and the boy. They were send back to Nummus Prosper by river, accompanied by Undine and Hademar. I shall not commit the details of his embarassing near-escape and the loss of a ship to writing. In the meantime, I had made the acquaintance of the man of the cloth that the venerable Archmage and Ash leader Philipus Niger had recommended to us. He seemed to be determined and a bit flexible in his faith, just like my taste. I have of course forgotten his name, since while he might be a pleasant character, he is but a mere mortal who perish like flies, so will likely as not be dead before we meet again. In any case, we found a rather disturbingly heretic book with the heathen wizard that had held the Flambeau Filius, and with the aid of the clergy said out to determine the source of the books.

Seeing as the venerable Archmage and Ash leader Philipus Niger himself had recommended him, I felt not held back by his presence in the use of my magic, and found the divine aura to weak to sincerly hamper my power. With his inventive and very direct methods and a bit of magical aid, we soon got to the man behind the spread of heretical thoughts among the worthless, innocent sheep of cologne. Incidentally, it was just when we had discovered his name that he sought a meeting with my esteemed colleague Vexator, likely as not to strike some deal for his silence and the return of the book. He was rather shocked when we all appeared, Hademar made short work of his henchman, and our clergymen sat down to have a talk with him. We left him in the good and proper care of the church, who will surely find a creative way to be rid of the troublemaker while having some fun doing it. I commend his soul to god.

As I already noted, we returned boy and abductor to the venerable Archmage and Ash leader Philipus Niger, an encounter the hedge wizard - who appears to have been, as I recall now, the father of the young apprentice - did not survive. I shall reflect a bit more on the events in Cologne and the annoying influence of the divine on spellcasting, then it is time to return to serious work.

      <comment>some cleanup</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7270">Prompted by our recent visit to Cologne, I have used the wasted season to commit some thoughts on Magi and the Divine to paper. I hope to be able to turn them into a Tractatus once, though they might have to be carefully checked for heresy, since the path of theology is a treacherous one rivaling the steepest mountain trails, where a single wrong step can see you plunging into the abyss.

It was, as the clergy teaches, His will that humanity rule the earth, and that they be partitioned in three: Those who toil, those who pray and those who fight.

Those who toil have the easiest lot in life, though it seems most of them do not realise this. Little is required of them then fulfilling the duty detailed by their lords, and following the prayer of the church. Little responsibilty rests on their shoulders, and it is thus no wonder that many of them display an astonishing lack of intelligence or independent thought: It is something that seems to be rather detrimental than helpful to their existence. Still their work is required so the other, more important parts of society can continue to functions.

Those who fight are indespensable and necessary in such a clear way that I will not lose words on them. Suffice to say that they carry the burden of caring for their people, defending the will of the Lord and speaking law in His name.

Then there are those most blessed by Him, those who have the privilege of doing His work directly: Those who pray. Yet while to the simple man the life of the clergy might seem an easy one, the opposite is true: They carry responsibilty for the souls of their flock, a burden that can hardly be understood by outsiders, since what are the discomforts of life compared to the souls fate in all eternity?

Yet not all men abide by His will, and thus there are those who do not belong to any of the three. It might be a compelling thought to discard them as heathens and heretics, lost souls who willingly ignore His word and thereby condemn themselves. And it is true that those who do not abide by divine order treat a path more treacherous than any others. Yet humanity is imperfect, stained by original sin and cast in a world of doubt, that only the faithful might prevail in His eyes and be, upon being cleansed in divine fire, accepted back in His loving arms. So who are those that do not belong in His order?

It is true that there are those who defy Him, who claim to know better than our Lord or simply do not care about their souls: The heathens and heretics. They are lost, their fates sealed by their stubborn ignorance, their only way to salvation offered by the solemn effort of those who pray. However, there are also those whose life is necessated by the imperfections of human society: Merchants, Mercenaries, and the like - and also, last but not least, Magi. For is not all creation His work? The Merchant who charges fair prices, who prays regularly, gives a tenth of his earnings to the church and lives by His commandments is still doing the lords work. However, temptations are manifold and often hidden, and so it are those who do not fit into the divine order and try to make up for humanity's imperfections that most often fall prey to demons and the like. Yet one should never forget that society necessiates them, and they are as much part of His creation as any being.

So what about the Magi? They are Gifted by Him with a power to change His very creation by their will. It is easy to see that such power can be used for much evil, but this should not be taken to mean such a use is its only possible application. Indeed it is the solemn duty of the Order of Hermes to seek out those who abuse their power and stop them, a duty carried out thoroughly since its founding about 400 years ago. It is also, though even many of the Order fail to see it, its duty to right other wrongs that have been done unto His creation by humans, fairies or demons. Indeed, while the clergy are blessed beyond all and care for our souls, the Magi are required to do the work that imperils the soul most: Leading. It might be thougt that nobility serve this purpose, yet theirs is a protective role: They fight to keep peasant and clergy safe, to regain the holy lands from the heathens. The role of the magi is an offensive one: For does not He command us to smite down all that oppose him? Would this be a world perfect in His eyes, Magi would not be necessary, and thus never be born. It is, however, not, and thus we are required to lead on until His kingdom comes.

As is often the case in His marvelous creation, the order he gave society is reflected in the gilds of the Rhine Tribunal.

There are the Elder and Hawthorn Gild, who preach protection of wilderness or fae. But does not the Lord say: &quot;Go forth and rule this earth in my name?&quot; Why, then, should fairy or beast be &quot;protected&quot; from rule of His children? Truly, these are the Heretic and the Heathen: Those who do not see the lord and revel in their bestiality, and those - even worse! - who see Him yet choose to associate with pagan fae.

The Apple Gild are those who toil, interacting with mortals to help and nurture them. They are those Magi who lack the strength of will to lead, yet put their Gift to work to help out the rest of the Order. As is so often the case with the low, though, they are discontent with their lot, failing to see His will, which has lead to the recent uprising calling itself the &quot;Lotharingian Tribunal&quot;.

The Linden Gild have the second role. It might be surprising, even contradictory, to call the Gild most interested in a smoothly running order a fighting one, yet recall that their fight is a defensive one: They protect the order from disintegration, from forces inside that seek its destruction. There fight is rarely one with weapon or spell, but one with word and wit, all the more dangerous for the power and ambitions of its combatants.

The Oak Gild, then, is clearly the force responsible for preserving the traditions of the order, making sure that things go as was the will of the founder. Theirs is an important role, and theirs is the right to call themselves the foremost wardens of Bonisagus' heritage.

Yet, as with all mundane society, the order is imperfect, perhaps stained at foundation by the sin of including heathen Diedne, and thus are required magi who are willing to risk their souls in the pursuit of outcasts, in the fight for the order with spell and weapon. This is the Ash Gild, and its role is as central to the functioning of the order as are the magi for the continuation of human civilisation. They carry the largest burdens and responsibily, a duty rarely honoured by other guilds and often misconstructed as arrogance or a simple hunger for power. Yet it is not a desire to rule for power's sake that motivates the Ash Gild, but the knowledge that they have the strength of will and personality to bear the immense burden leadership is.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1019">[[Aphanius]]' Talisman is a small tiara he usually wears around his head. It is made of wood from the Rowan tree, reinforced by two long bands of iron wrapped around the wood, crossing each other numerous times (the iron thus gives a pattern like xxxxxx). On the front the tiara carries the Symbol of House Tremere (a square inscribed in the symbol of Mars).

The Talisman currently has a capacity of 7 pawns, 2 of which are taken by the following effects:

* Flight of Frau Holles Feathers

ReCo 18 (6 uses/day, Item maintains concentration)

The wearer can move slowly in any direction, not requiring support. If he wishes to change his movement, he must concentrate, otherwise the item maintains the effect. In fact, he appears to simply blow about as a snowflake gripped by the wind - thus the name of the effect. 

(Base 5, +1 Concentration, +1 Item maintains concentration, +3 6 uses/day)

It is attuned to grant Aphanius a +7 bonus on spells to harm or repel fairies, due to its iron component.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="953">In the year 1221, when our [[Nummus Prosper Saga|fine covenant]] was founded, House Tremere has tasked me with the following:

* Investigate the fate of Tremere Magi at Trier.
: This I have done, and received a Vim Tractatus in Return. 

* Report on local faerie courts, their influences and politics.
: I am still gathering information, but will likely have enough for a full report soon. I shall request a Lab Text for &quot;Sight of Active Magics&quot; with Sun Duration in return.

* Lead the covenant with wisdom to success.
: I am still working on this, and will likely be all my life. What is the purpose of such a generic task?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4633">[[Vexator]] used his magics to don the form of Jorgen von Sinningen, a
minor noble and distant relative of the Baron von Kirchberg. He had
built up the background of Jorgen over the past few months and it was
now time to test it. He arrived at the castle of Baron Schönburg and
requested an audience with the lord. 

After the initial pleasantries are over, Jorgen starts to talk
business. &quot;My lord Schönburg, I have heard that you are in somewhat of
a predicament... your daughter is of a marriageable age, is she not?&quot;
The face of the baron hints a slight frown: &quot;Indeed she is. There have
been suitors, but not every man has been up to the task. And the
latest, most promising suitor, a young nobleman named Otto, has just
recently declined. Very surprisingly, I must add.&quot; 

Of course he did, Vexator thought. He had tried to keep track of the
suitors of Karlotta, the daughter of the baron, and had immediately
seen that this Otto was the most serious contender, and thus the most
serious danger to his plan to get a hold in the family of his
liege-lord. He had seen to it that most potential suitors were either
dissuaded or discredited, but this Otto had proven more stubborn. In
the end, he had let Undine do some Mentem-magics to get Otto out of
harm's way.

Jorgen did not let any of these thoughts show. &quot;A pity indeed, for
your daughter is... high spirited and a beauty to behold. Let me see
if I can offer any help. Recently, I have been a guest at a castle
nearby -- Burg Pfalz, in the Rhine, just a few miles from here? I
trust you know of it? I'm not fully familiar with the demesnes of the
nobles here, but aren't they some kind of vassal of yours? In any
case, there was a splendid young man of a compatible age at the
castle. He might seem a bit strange at first... intimidating
perhaps. He is tall, taller than the tallest man I have seen before!
Hademar is his name, and I have talked with him on some occasions. He
seems to be able to trace is ancestry to some minor noble line in the
Swiss Alps... I am not fully sure, but I could do a more thorough
check if you wish. Perhaps he would be a suitable husband for your
daughter? I have seen that your daughter also has her share
of... strangeness... in her blood. Hademar would be strong and
dependable, he is of noble background and seems to be in charge of the
castle of his own, with a good source of income. If you wish, I could
arrange for a meeting?&quot;

Baron Schönburg looked up, somewhat surprised. &quot;Hademar? I not only
know of him, I actually know him! Burg Pfalz is indeed a vassal of
mine, I let the scholars on the castle run the day-to-day business of
collecting the tolls on the Rhine, and I receive a share of the tolls
as scutage. Hademar, hm? It never occurred to me... He is indeed of a
fine stature. Please look into his family history, and perhaps arrange
for a meeting? If possible, Hademar should come here and we'll have
the two meet. I must say I spoil my child -- if she does not find
Hademar to her liking, there will be no marriage!&quot; 

--

Overall, Vexator was pleased with himself. The wedding was now in full
ceremony, and he was attending it in the shape of Jorgen,
again. Karlotta hat accepted Hademar, who in turn rather cherished the
idea of being married into a &quot;fully&quot; noble family. With a few tricks
and omissions, Vexator had been able to only show the &quot;good&quot; parts of
Hademar's family tree, and silently disregarding the estranged parts
Hademar ''actually'' hailed from. 

Everybody at the wedding was slightly squishy about the huge size of
Hademar, but it was mostly re-interpreted as a sign of manliness and
strength. Of the magi, Undine was cheerily mingling with the mundanes,
her Gentle Gift makeing such things easy. Aphanius stood a bit apart
and was watching the commotion with interest. He, just as Vexator, was
already calculating the benefits of having a more direct control over
their (mundane) future. If the old Baron died now, Hademar would
manage the estate for his wife, the daughter of Schönburg. This might
bring some trouble with the quaesitors, but nothing Aphanius shouldn't
be able to handle, Vexator thought. We give free reign to all our more
important covenant staff, after all. And let the quaesitors come. He'd
love another verbal battle with them. Stupid Tabanus, arguing that
merely ''living'' next to mundanes would already be enough to qualify
for a High Crime of meddling with mundanes! He would need to check
if Nummus Prosper was still on the &quot;no-go&quot; list of the Cabal of the
Flypaper, Vexator reminded himself. It was about time for another
Cabal meeting anyway...

talked with [[Albrecht]] and he has (reluctantly, and only after
considerable pressure) set up a &quot;Children's Fund&quot; for the prospective
mothers. He said that it might not be such a terrible bad idea after
all, as we currently have a predominantly male group of
covenfolk. Some women to do the traditional woman's work will help the
covenant finances, he said. No matter, what do I care? 

Now to the prospective mothers. I have been searching the general
vicinity of our covenant for suitably pretty, spiritual, and charming
young ladies. With some persuasion (tricking the gullible, bribing the
aspiring, impressing the docile, and magically inducing the stubborn)
I have succeeded in my strategy. In fact, I must say that this task
was entirely enjoyable, and I quite fell for my &quot;girls&quot;!

the finest potion to be useful, as I do not wish to further bother my
life with the longevity ritual. Hard work once will save me a lot of
trouble in the years to come! I have already made some
[[Tribunal of 1227#Longevity Ritual|first inquiries]]
at the [[Tribunal of 1227|last Tribunal]] and I believe two main
contenders remain for who is allowed the honour to craft my longevity
ritual: Epidauros in the far-away Theben Tribunal, and Sinews of
Knowledge, in the more nearby Greater Alps Tribunal. 

== Epidauros == 

I shall write a letter to the covenant in the far Thebes
Tribunal. They are reputedly the very best the Order has to offer in
terms of healing and longevity rituals. I wonder what they charge, and
if their reputation is even justified?

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
Salve sodalis of Epidauros! &lt;br /&gt;

Even here in the far reaches of the Rhine Tribunal the redcaps have
heard of your legendary prowess in creating longevity rituals. I
myself am now entering the age where I need to seriously think about
my own longevity ritual, and I would like only the very best of
rituals. &lt;br /&gt;

I would like to enquire the possibility of having my longevity ritual
made by a member of your covenant, the very best specialist in
longevity rituals the Order has to offer. What would the price be for
such a ritual? Mere vis would be insulting the craftsmanship and
splendour of such a ritual, so perhaps I could offer services of
similar value? Perhaps you would need an agent, or an ambassador, in
the Rhine Tribunal? I would gladly take up these tasks. &lt;br /&gt;

Another wish, if I may be so bold. Would it be possible to add a small
arcane connection, perhaps a small piece of rock to your answer
letter? An arcane connection to somewhere close to your covenant, that
I can use my Rego magics to easily come by. Nothing surpasses a
personal conversation, so once I have the arcane connection, I would
be much obliged if it were possible for me to stay a few days as guest
in your covenant.  &lt;br /&gt;

Your humble servant, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Vexator Silvanum, filius Venator Silvanum of House Tytalus&lt;br /&gt;
Covenant of Nummus Prosper, Rhine Tribunal&lt;br /&gt;
Fall 1227
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After three or four seasons, a reply arrives. It is a strange-looking and strange-smelling scroll; on the wax seal is the symbol of a snake wrapped around a staff. The script is also unusual. The delivering Redcap says that he has brought an accompanying Arcane Connection, which one of his colleagues had to gather, and requests a pawn of vis for this service.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
To the noble magus Vexator Silvanum of the esteemed Covenant of Nummus Prosper in the First Tribunal, Xenias the Leper of House Tytalus bids you Greetings,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

With the Blessings of Hermes (or Mercury as you call Him) and Asklepios, May this letter find you in good health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

For a suitable consideration, I, or one of my covenant-mates, would be willing to attend to your Mortality Needs. You would, of course, need to spend a season at Epidauros. For maximum Efficacy, you may wish to consider use of the Enkoimeteria and/or the Blood of Medusa, for which a charge of one Rook of vis and five Pawns of vis, respectively, applies. Further to this you will need to supply the vis for the Ritual itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Should you wish Myself to craft this Ritual, then I should request a modest Consideration. I do not usually receive payment in Vis, but if so, I should think that one Rook would be more than adequate. Alternatively, perhaps you would be willing to provide copies of some Latin books from one of the famed Rhine Libraries? One hears that the Spirit of Bonisagos Himself still protects the Grand Library of Durenmar. My Covenant and I have an interest in such Latin texts from the First Tribunal. Even if not directly of interest to us, we would be able to trade them with others. However we would strongly prefer Tomes of Quality from Authors blessed with the Gift of Athene, not merely Baser Texts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I have asked the Redcaps to procure for you an Arcane Connection to the Acrocorinth, near to the ancient city of Corinth in the Peloponnese. I am given to understand this may entail a cursory charge of vis. From there, you will find it is but a day or two's Travel to the Asklepieion; the Redcaps will give you Instructions. Our Humble Covenant would be Honoured to receive You.
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Vexator replies positively: 

(Note: [[Vis]] is deducted. The 15 pawns for the Enkoimeteria and the Blood of Medusa goes via Redcap, the 7 pawns for the LR I'll take with me and deposit in person.) 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
To the noble and wise magus Xenias the Leper of House Tytalus,
Covenant of Epidauros in the Theben Tribunal, &lt;br /&gt;

My most humble thanks and eternal gratitude for your kind and generous
offer. I would gladly come to Epidauros and have my longevity ritual
crafted by one of the greatest living specialists known to the
Order. I would also like to peruse the Enkoimeteria and the Blood of
Medusa, please find the necessary Vis to use these two ingredients
with this letter. If possible, I would like to tax the hospitality of
your covenant in the Fall season of 1232. &lt;br /&gt;

Concerning your most deserved and very modest Consideration, there is
a slight hickup. The Great Library is not only protected by the ghost
of Bonisagus himself, but, sadly, and much more fiercely, by his
descendants concerned only with petty squabbles. The covenant Durenmar
does not allow copies to be made of any books in the Great
Library. They prefer to keep the treasures jealously guarded in their
towers, and wish not to share them with the Order. Oh yes, any magus
is allowed to study in the Great Library to fulfil their part of the Hermetic Oath, but only if he has presented
a book to the Library beforehand. I will nevertheless see what I can
do. If the magi of Durenmar do not prove to be accommodating, I shall
endeavour to find a suitable alternative. &lt;br /&gt;

If you are interested in books from the Great Library, I have heard
rumours that the presiding Bonisagi will allow copies of books to be
made for trade for mere Vis. Should this pique your fancy, I can see
what I am able to set up, and we can discuss trades once I am in
Thebes. &lt;br /&gt;

Remaining your humble servant, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Sinews of Knowledge ==

Archmage Paxon of House Verditius is said to be the very best in terms
of longevity rituals, but being a Verditius, and an Archmage to boot,
his prices will surely be more than daylight robbery. I hear that even
other Archmagi cannot get his attention, and even this ''entirely''
unbelievable rumour that he will not accept payment in Vis any more,
as he has too much of it! A Verditius magus refusing Vis payments?
Surely that must be wrong. He'd be instantly cast out of his
money-grubbing, vis-hoarding, monopolistic thug-ridden House! 

To stay realistic, Archmaga Philomena offers probably only slightly
less perfect services for a (barely) affordable Vis cost. It is said
that she charges two rooks of Vis, 12 pawns of which have to be
Techniques for one season of her time to complete a longevity
ritual. I shall write her a letter, asking her if this is correct, and
if she could spare me a season of her time some time in 1232.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
Salve achimaga Philomena, filia XXX of House Bonisagus(?) &lt;br /&gt;

I hope I am not overstepping my boundaries in being so bold and claiming a few diameters of your precious
research time. As an ageing magus, I require a longevity ritual in the
next years. Only the very best ritual would suffice, and in searching
the best longevity specialists of the Order, you were most heartily
recommended. I was led to believe that the going rate for a season of
your precious time was two rooks of vis, of which 12 pawns need to be
vis tenta. &lt;br /&gt;

May I humbly ask if it were possible for you to craft a longevity
ritual for myself some time in the year 1232, and if the information I
have been given concerning your compensation practices are correct?&lt;br /&gt;

Your humble servant, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Vexator Silvanum, filius Venator Silvanum of House Tytalus&lt;br /&gt;
Covenant of Nummus Prosper, Rhine Tribunal&lt;br /&gt;
Fall 1227
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A reply arrives:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
Dear Honnored Magus,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I hope you will ekxcuse and understand that my Apprentice scribes this missive in my stead, due to current Arcane circomestances and an ekxess of Correspondence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Your information regarding the costs of my services is indeed accurate. It is possibul I could accomodate you in the Autumn Season of 1232, but you would need to schedoule this with a downpayment, preferably two years in advance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

With cordial regards, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Philomena, Archimaga Bonisagi
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To which Vexator replies: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
Salve achimaga Philomena, filia XXX of House Bonisagus(?) &lt;br /&gt;

Thank you for setting aside some of your precious time for me, and also to dedicate some of your apprentice's time to write the letter -- although, of course, his time is worth far less than yours! Due to unforeseen circumstances, I sadly no longer have the possibility to visit your covenant and peruse your exquisite services. I therefore, sadly, need to respectfully decline your gracious offer. Please do feel welcomed in the covenant of Nummus Prosper, should you ever visit the Rhine Tribunal! &lt;br /&gt;

Your humble servant, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4688">I have often thought about effects that might prove very helpful in certain situations, but that I did not have then. In order to avoid them slipping my mind, I have taken to write down possible outlines of formulaic spells. The invention of those will have to be delayed, though, until I find myself with some spare time.



* A Story cast in Iron

ReVi 25

R: Touch, D: Sun, T:Individual

The magus touches a subject, sealing him from the influences of faeries.
A Faerie of Might 25 or less, against which this Spell penetrates, is
unable to physically or magically affect the target before the sun next
sets or rises.

(General Effect)

: As I intend to have more dealings with the Fae in the future, this spell should prove invaluable. It will also work on my trusted shield grog, [[Günther]], and anyone else accompanying us. I estimate I can develop a version powerful enough to ward against most lesser Fae, so I need not worry about their nuisance when traversing their domains.

* Read between the Lines

InVi(Im) 25

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Individual

The magus inspects a faeries glamour, reading hints that help him
identify the target, like the level of detail the glamour possesses, how
old the body appears, and so on. This information grants a +6 bonus to a
Farie Lore roll made to gain more information about the target, but this
bonus is itself capped by the casters Faerie Lore - a certain amount of
existing knowledge is needed to use the information this spell provides.

(InVi 5, +2 Voice, + 2 additional information, requisite necessary)

: I have often wondered what details could be gleamed from the glamour of a Faerie. I think I have an idea how to read it using the Forms of Vim and Imaginem, though Experimentation will have to show if this works the way I want.

* Mute Malign Magic

PeVi 25

R:Voice, D:Mom, T:Individual

This spell dispells any effects on the target of Level less than half of
35+stress die (no botch).

(General Effect, +2 Voice)

:A generic effect to dispell hostile magic is never wrong. Weak magic (like those of hedgies) can usually be countered by spontaneous spells, but stronger magic, like some fae effects, will require a formula.

* Vantage Point

InIm 10

R:Touch, D:Concentration, T:Structure

As long as the magus touches the target and concentrates, he can use his
sense of vision from any point belonging to the structure - i.e.,
touching a large tower, he can spy into a room inside it or look from
its top without climbing it.

(Base 1, +1 Touch, +1 Concentration, +3 Structure)

: I think this effect will be sufficiently easy to accomplish so I don't need a to develop a formulaic spell.

* The Lingering Tale

ReVi 20

R: Voice, D:Moon, T:Individual

This spell prolongs the duration of another spell cast by anyone to
Moon, if the original Spell is of level 10 or lower. Aphanius uses this
spell to prolong spontaneously created effects, which are usually
difficult to cast with prolonged durations. The very long duration given
by this spell is not much of a problem, since a spontaneously created
spell is very easy to cancel with a PeVi Spell due to its low level.

(General Effect, +2 Voice, +3 Moon)

: Usually, it is difficult to create spontaneous spells of any duration, yet it would be very good to have them in many unforeseen circumstances. This spell should accomplish such, and is therefore high priority.

* Ways of the Gnomes

Mu(Re)Te(He) 20

R: Touch, D:Concentration, T:Individual+1size

This spell allows the magus to pass through any wooden, earthen or stone
obstacle unhindered by causing it to wrap around him, leaving a small
bubble in which he can breathe. He can only move at a quickened pace,
not run, since the spell continously moves earth. The spell requires
concentration to keep going, since the touched target changes continuosly (needless to say, losing concentration on this spell while stuck in an obstacle is dangerous to say the least ...).

(Base 3, +1 Touch, +1 Concentration, +1 Size, +1 affect stone, +1
Herbam Requisite, Rego Requisite free)

: I have often wished for an effect that would lower the impact of barriers to travel. Since some of the fae have no problems doing this, I think I know how to imitate their powers. It is extremely dangerous to lose concentration on this spells, so I think I will put it into an item. My talisman, perhaps?

:[[Aphanius]], Filius Clemens, Filius Stentorius, Filius (irgendwann sollten wir mal die Namen hier beschließen, Andrew), Filius Tremere of House Tremere 
:Princeps of the Covenant of Nummus Prosper
:in the Chapter House of the Covenant of Nummus Prosper located at Waldheim
:in the Autumn of the Year 1230

      <comment>a new faerie tale spreads in the Rhine Gorge ...</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3418">The noise in the taproom reduces to a lower level as the young man with the harp settles down on one of the tables. &quot;A tale!&quot; - &quot;Yes, tell us a tale!&quot; - &quot;Sing!&quot;, the drunken voices shout. The young man picks up his harp and touches the string, striking up a small melody to accompany his introductory words.

&quot;Tonight, I shall tell you a tale of a young man from the woods, and how he won his knighthood. It is a story from the famous Westerwald, the faerie woods close to this dwelling.&quot;

There is some murmur in the room as the bard mentions the woods. Too many remembered the tale of [[Hömberg]], a failed attempt at settling the woods.

&quot;Our hero goes by the name of Aphanius. He is a young man who grew up in the woods, raised by their inhabitants, but rescued from their clutches by a travelling monk. He learned the way of our saviour, and when he came of age he decided he would take up arms to protect others from the wickedness of the fey he suffered as a child. But to take up arms he would have to win the title of knight, for it is not allowed for the common man to bear arms and a banner.&quot;

There is silence in the taproom now. The young man has certainly captured his audience's attention as his play becomes louder.

&quot;What makes a knight? An old source tells us, that he is a knight, who carries a [[Aphanius' Talisman|lance]] in battle, [[Aphanius visits the Court of Bright Winter|proves]] his worth in romance and has a [[Aphanius visits the Court of Dark Summer|squire]] to take care of mundane tasks...&quot;

The bard's voice becomes more melodic now as he starts to sing. The melody is almost playful, with some suprising turns.

He tells of a lance, a length of wood with an iron tip, and how it is the sign of knighthood. He tells how the hero of his tale shows his wit when he crafts himself a small tiara of wood, and adorns it with a symbol at the front. Thus he appears no more armed than a maiden, when in truth he carries a knight's weapon.

The bard makes a brief pause to drink some of the ale that the maid had put next to him, then he continues. The melody now is a bit melancholic, but the notes are very clear and determined. He sings how a knight need not only be skilled in battle, but also in the art of chivalric romance, and how many a fighter failed the test of courtship. In his tale, the hero wanders the woods at length, asking plants and birds who the most beautiful maiden in the forest is, always receiving the answer that is the queen of winter, but that she has a heart of ice that no man can warm. The hero still steps up to the task, and while he fails to warm her heart, his display of affection is sufficient to grant him her favour. Thus he masters his second task.

The bard pauses again, drinking another ale. Then he picks up the harp, this time starting a sinister melody, with a threatening undertone. He tells how the last tale would prove the most dangerous, as our hero seeks out another faerie queen to wrest his squire from hero in a battle of wits...

(wait for play-by-wiki to finish)

At the end, the tale is well received. The young man smiles to himself as he moves on to drinking with the crowd in the taproom. He was getting paid to do this, by some weird guy he had met ... getting paid to do something that would pay even further was not the worst think, though he did not look forward to meeting his employer again anytime soon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6436">[[Image:Taverne.jpg|thumb|300px|Taverne ''Zum zebrochenen Krug'']][[Image:Barde.jpg|thumb|300px|Der große Grannus, Barde]]

The breeze came from the wrong direction. ''&quot;The wine song&quot;'' was omnipresent. Undine arose with bloodshot eyes. Generally the nearby village was quiet, especially at night. But since this accursed bard appeared, the tavern was buzzing. She staggered to the window and glanced at the stars. Around midnight. She rubbed her face. This has to end. Undine left the building, went to the water and jumped in.

The otter crawled ashore and shook its body. The water is cold, this time of the year. The otter lolled and stretched until he finally grew, assuming baroque shape. His hair fell to the ground, crumbled and vanished, pink flesh appeared underneath. The creature grew even larger, until - until a small woman was standing at the river, wringing her wet hair. Suddenly a faint colourful haze appeared around her and dissipated again. She knelt down in the grass and raked it with her fingers. With every stroke, more and more grass piled up in front of her. She reached into the pile and pulled out a garb. These spells are so handy! Turning the garb, Undine inspected it from the front and the back. Satisfied, she put it on. Dry and dressed she started walking.

Undine hasn't been to the village very often (especially at night), but the tavern was hard to miss. She just followed the sound.

The tavern was a rather big building for such a small village and has already seen his best days. A barely readable sign said: ''&quot;Zum zebrochenen Krug&quot;''. Undine closed her eyes and held her breath. With her bare feet she could feel the ground shaking from the pandemonium inside. She looked about, but the street was empty. Undine screamed something in a strange language (even then she could barely hear herself) and slammed her fist against the wall. Faint smoke emerged from the windows and the door. The hullabaloo died away. A jug shattered on the floor. Then there was silence. Undine smiled and walked away.

----

''&quot;Vom Südhang kommt der beste Wein vom Rhein! So süß und beerig, oh wie fein!&quot;'' Gah! Undine sat upright in her bed. Good Lord. The peace lasted less than a day. Accursed bard! May his balls shrivel and rot. She grabbed for her clothes and left the room.

Aphanius and Relentus were in the Chapter House. Lucky them! If it would not be highly inefficient to abandon her half-finished project, she would have fled there, too. On her way to the shore, she saw light emerging from the castle. Undine turned around. Vexator and Albrecht were sitting in a room at ground level, less exposed to &lt;i&gt;&quot;the wine song&quot;&lt;/i&gt; than in the office or the lab. With tired eyes they were trying to read. &quot;Hey Vexator!&quot; Slowly, he looked up. &quot;I will bring you a present.&quot; Vexator looked at her for a while before he silently went back to reading. Undine was not sure, if he did not understand or just ignored her. Maybe both. She went back to the waterside. This time she took the boat.

On the mainland, she walked a swift pace. The street was as empty as yesterday. She arrived at the tavern. Before she reached the door, she startled by the sound of a window breaking. A young man fell on the grass, broken glass around him. He got up, leered at Undine, barfed on his shoes and tried to climb back trough the window. Undine turned up her nose on him and went to the front door. Gathering all her strength, she kicked at the door. At the second attempt, she succeeded and the door swung wide open. The desired effect of attention failed to appear. She was hardly noticed. So she fought her way through to the bard who entertained the cheering plebs with his awful songs. &quot;Hey, Lieder-Schmied!&quot;, she screamed. Now she had his attention. &quot;Es gibt Leute, die müssen Arbeiten. Und schlafen.&quot; The crowd was hooting. The bard sneered: &quot;Der große Grannus hört nicht einfach auf. Nicht heute Nacht. Seht ihr nicht, dass den Leuten meine Lieder gefallen? Meine Ode an den Wein haben wir heute erst drei mal gesungen. Wir werden nicht ruhen, bevor der Morgen graut.&quot; Cheering approval. This won't work, Undine thought. But it actually would have surprised her, if it had. What makes him tick? She looked him in the eyes and reached for his mind.

Oh boy. She wouldn't have needed magic to find that out. &quot;Grannus Lieder-Schmied, wir machen eine Wette. Ich feiere mit Euch. Die ganze Nacht. Und tanze nackt auf Tischen. Wenn Du mich im Armdrücken besiegst.&quot; For a second, no one said a word. Then the crowd went berserk. The bard laughed out loud. &quot;Und was passiert, werte Dame, in dem unwahrscheinlichen Fall, dass Ihr stärker seid, als ich? Wenn sich unter ihrer Robe Muskelberge türmen, die ich bis jetzt übersah?&quot; &quot;Dann, Lieder-Schmied, bist Du mein persönlichen Sklave. Für einen halben Mond.&quot; Before he even had a chance to answer, four guests of the tavern were already carrying a large table and put it in front of Undine and the bard. Undine sat down. The bard hesitated, sensing a trap, but the people were already jostling him to the table. He held out his arm and Undine put her slender hand in his. Two pair of eyes stare at each other. No one blinks. The people count down: &quot;Drei! Zwei! Eins! Looos!&quot; The bard rolled his eyes until only the whites could be seen and he flagged. With all the strength she could come up with, Undine slammed his hand on the table. Suddenly the bard awoke and looked disbelieving on his hand lying on the table. His unseeing eyes stared at the surrounding people. &quot;Un... Unmöglich! Das, das ist... Das kann nicht...&quot; Some of the guests started exulting, but most of them realised that the party was over. &quot;Komm mit mir. Und gewöhne Dich schon einmal daran: Du wirst nichts sagen. Keinen Laut machen. Für einen halben Mond.&quot;

Undine shoved the bard into the boat, got in herself and said: &quot;Bring mich zurück zur Insel.&quot; He opened his mouth to protest, but she said: &quot;Ich bin nicht nur stärker als Du, ich kann auch machen, dass Deine Eier abfaulen.&quot; He closed his mouth again and started rowing.

During the next fortnight, castle Kaub was cleaned thoroughly. A few people wondered, who this submissive guy with the broom in his hand was, always with humped back, never saying a single word. But most people just enjoyed the silence. No one ever dared to sing ''&quot;the wine song&quot;'' again. And the bard Grannus was never heard of ever after.

      <comment>magi might really appear a &quot;bit&quot; weird at times</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2026">After the destruction of the infernal mice, Aphanius goes to sleep, tired from all the spontaneous spells and running around as an ape. On the next day, he is already up exceptionally early (i.e., two hours before noon) and orders [[Günther]] to catch some sleep during the day since he will need him for the night. The Grog obeys, but silently prays that they will return to [[Waldheim]] soon, so he can stand guard again, separated from all the craziness of his master by a solid wooden door.

His prayers are apparently not answered, since Aphanius, unusually cheerful the entire day, calls him from his slumber as soon as the sun has set and takes him to the tree. He orders Günther to stand watch while he is busy, and mentions that he might appear a bit ... absent. With more preparation time, Aphanius has a more thought-through approach to magical exploration of the underground lair than two nights before. He picks up a pebble from the river's bank, and starts enchanting it, taking his time to catch his breath in between the spontaneous spells. At one point, the pebble vanishes from sight, but the Grog decides it is best not to know what exactly his master is planning.

After some time has passed, Aphanius lifts his hands to the hole in the tree (he makes a weird gesture as if holding something between his fingers, but there is nothing) and again casts a spell. Then he stands motionless, only casting a spell from time to time. Günther sometimes sees the face of his master light up, then it appears very calm again. Sometimes he almost flinches, sweat appearing on his brows, but he never speaks a word to Günther. Only when the sun rises does he finally stir from his sitting position next to the tree, tiredly nodding to Günther to leave. &quot;I shall need you again next dusk. Be ready.&quot;

And such, Aphanius and his Grog spend several days next to the tree, always initiated by the same procedure of Aphanius collecting a pebble and enchanting it before sitting down next to the tree.

      <comment>Aphanius in love ; )</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2070">Last night, before we found the lair of the mice and exterminated the infernal incursion, something really unexpected happened. We were following the strange stench of rotting water that permeates the air on the southern island and can also be found here, somehow mistaking it for the source of infernal influence. The aura was definitely magic, as I easily noticed. After a short walk, we reached a larger water cavern ... where something was moving. I cast a spontaneous PeVi spell to destroy demons in the room, but nothing happened. Then tentacles appeared and started reaching for me. I had to use spontaneous ReCo magic to get myself away from danger.

Still, the first thought that crossed my mind when the creature appeared was not &quot;Danger!&quot;, but &quot;Familiar!&quot;. Perhaps, this explains why I took until almost the last second to get away from the approaching tentacles. Something about the creature just struck a chord within me. All evidence says that where Familiars are concerned, one should trust his instincts, and so shall I. I will have to find out more about it ... so much to learn. I shall spend the rest of the Summer season here at Pfalz Island, to explore the habitat and habits of the creature. Then I will return to Waldheim, to see if I can construct a suitable lair there. I think with some Perdo Terram magics, as last night, it should be possible to create caverns below my lab that connect to the wood's surface outside. The rain will fill them with water. I shall have to make plans and take measurements once I return. I shall also have to find some space in my laboratory. Perhaps I will finally move my living quarters to the upper part of the building.

I'm so excited! Tonight I shall start my exploration. Now, what spells best to use ... ?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8155">Vexator arrived at the destination of the arcane connection. It
was warm, very warm. The sun was bristling hot in the sky, and
the landscape was considerably different from the Rhine Gorge:
dry, brownish-yellow, and much more stony. The Redcaps had given
him the direction Vexator would need to take to arrive in
Epidauros. Just take the road along the coast -- the sea breeze
was quite refreshing, Vexator thought -- and a little while to
the north and some ancient buildings should be visible, the
Redcaps had instructed him. 

Sure enough, after only a short while a rag-tag of ruins and
buildings appeared on a hillside, one noticeably larger and in
better state of repair than the others. A small village was
below this, with a number of men and women to be seen. &quot;This
must be it&quot;, Vexator thought while the men eyed the strange
visitor suspiciously. He tried to ask the villagers in Latin if
this was Epidauros, but they did not understand. Most kept away
from him, but the word &quot;Epidauros&quot; did provoke some positive
reactions and nodding from some. After a while, a woman
approached him slowly -- she was lame, and needed the support of
her staff to move at all. &quot;Salve&quot;, she greeted Vexator in a
broken Latin. &quot;My name is Galla of the House of Ex
Miscellanea. Please excuse my Latin, it is not fluid for
speaking. How may I help you? What you look here in
Epidauros?&quot;. 

An Ex Misc, not very promising for such a famed covenant Vexator
thought. Still, he knew that there were quite a few specialist
magi in this riffraff House, so this one might be a Corpus
specialist. &quot;Salve sodalis. My name is Vexator Silvanum of House
Tytalus. I have come to speak to Xenias of Tytalus of the
covenant of Epidauros. Am I correct here?&quot; Galla nodded at the
mentioning of the name Xenias. &quot;Ah, you must be magus of Rhine
Tribunal. Xenias has speaking of you. But we not expect you so
early!&quot; -- &quot;Well, I have other, more magical means of travel at
my disposal, so I can travel in less time.&quot; Galla motioned
Vexator to follow her. The walk up would take a long time, with
Vexator trotting impatiently beside the lame maga. &quot;Please come
with me, I will bring you to Xenias. It is good having visitors
from other Tribunals here. Please talking to me of Durenmar, the
center of our Order!&quot; 

A quiet tingling sound of a bell announced the presence of
Xenias the Leper. He came in leper's clothing, near-fully
veiled, with the exception of his eyes. A bell was attached to
his belt to announce his leprous presence to his
surroundings. Vexator was slightly taken aback. He knew that
Xenias was a leper -- his name being the very first hint, and he
also knew the his House had still a few of these leprous magi
left, who drew significant powers from their ailment. Still,
seeing a leper in full &quot;regalia&quot; was a little
gruesome. &quot;Welcome, sodalis Vexator to our covenant, a place of
healing and resting. I trust you are in good health?&quot; Vexator
nodded. &quot;It is such a pleasure and honour to have you as our
guest. Please, let me show you the ''Enkoimeteria'', where we
will craft the longevity ritual for you. It is a building
perfectly suited and attuned to this task. The spirit of
Asklepios himself will watch over the process!&quot; 

The remainder of the day was spent with Xenias showing Vexator
the buildings and explaining the various steps that would be
undertaken to ensure a perfect longevity ritual. Later, Xenias
would approach Vexator during the evening meal. 

&quot;My dear sodalis. I wish to endeavour a boon... You hail from
the Rhine Tribunal, do you not? I believe Durenmar holds the
combined records of all Bonisagus magi?&quot; Vexator nearly choked
on his food. &quot;Durenmar? Well, yes, I suppose they ''do'' hold
the records of all Bonisagi. But, truth be told, from the few
visits I had in Durenmar, the record-keeping prowess of that
covenant is not exactly formidable...&quot; Xenias looked a little
disappointed but nevertheless continued. &quot;Still, perhaps you
would be able to help. We have a magus here who is in a bit of a
precocious situation. His name is Garabed, might I be able to
introduce you later to him? He will be able to explain his
difficulties better than I can hope to relay. If I may be so
bold, I would consider it a personal favour if you could help
him. He has some business to attend to in the Rhine Tribunal, in
Durenmar in particular.&quot; 

---

Vexator met with Garabed, a rather small, frightful young
man. &quot;Xenias told me that you needed some assistance in finding
something out in Durenmar? Searching the records there?&quot; Garabed
nodded. &quot;I must tell you, do not get your hopes too high&quot;,
Vexator continued, &quot;the Bonisagi there are not the most
organised of magi... What is your problem, specifically?&quot; Garabed
sighed and started talking. Slowly, carefully at first, but then
more firm, with more confidence as his talk went on. His Latin
was very good, Vexator thought. 

&quot;Well, let me start by explaining where I come from. I am not
native of the Theben Tribunal, at least I do not think so. For
as long as I can remember, I have been the apprentice of a magus
who called himself Hippolytus, a Bonisagus Seeker. He was driven
to find Noah's Ark in the Armenian mountains. He is -- was --
old, very old, and Twilight-ridden. Most of the time I couldn't
understand what he was saying, and the times I did understand
him, his utterings made only partial sense. Therefore, I am not
even fully certain if his name actually ''was'' Hippolytus.

My master and another magus, an Ex Misc magus by the name of
Vokharinel, had set up their laboratories in the Armenian
mountains far to the east of here. I got my training from my
master, and sometimes Vokharinel would add a few lessens,
particularly towards the end of my apprenticeship, when my
master was acting more and more strange and incomprehensible. I
finished my studies, passed my gauntlet, and was taught the
secrets of Parma Magica. An unfortunate accident happened, and
my pater went into Final Twilight. Now, here I stand, and I have
no way of actually proving that I am a magus of House Bonisagus,
in fact I am not too sure myself! I was never presented at any
Tribunal. I believe my pater said that we are nominally part of
the Novgorod tribunal, but we never went to any Tribunal
meetings, never had any Redcaps visit us, we never saw a single
other magus in all those 18 years of my apprenticeship! I don't
think the Novgorod Tribunal knew that we existed, but we were so
far away from any other covenant. No wonder not even the Redcaps
came to visit us!

I vowed that I would find my rightful place as a magus of House
Bonisagus, in a proper covenant, in a proper Tribunal, with
records and proof. I knew next to nothing of the Order of
Hermes, only a few facts I managed to pick up from my
master. The Ex Misc wasn't helpful in that regard, either. Most
of the time he was outside chanting his weather magics. So, I
went out in search of other magi. I knew that a covenant existed
in Constantinople, so I went there.

Upon arriving, I realised first that everything my master had
told me was untrue: Constantinople was held my Latin nobility,
there had been a great war, most covenants were abandoned or
razed. I managed to find my way to here, only to hear that the
Thebes Tribunal has never heard of me, my pater, not even of our
covenant! I have been put up to date concerning the Order as a
whole, so now I would like to go to Durenmar and check the
records of the Bonisagi there. Xenias told me that you are from
the First Tribunal, are you not? Could you direct me to Durenmar
and help me out?&quot; 

The &quot;Bonisagus&quot; looked imploringly at Vexator. A story so
fantastic, it had to be true, the Tytalus thought. Even if not,
the possibility and fun of having a &quot;lost&quot; Bonisagus running
around was just too good to let slip. &quot;I do not know how much I
can help you, and as I said, the records of Durenmar are in
chaotic disarray. But I can present you at Durenmar and see to
it that you can search the records there. The rest you will have
to manage on your own!&quot;

Gladly, Garabed accepted the offer. Time to change my travel
plans slightly, thought Vexator...

    <title>Notes on the intrusion of a foolish Bjornaer magus upon the lands rightfully claimed by the covenant of Nummus Prosper</title>

      <comment>My Ego! I forgot my Ego! God shoot me, what happened?!</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4179">Events have transpired that lead me to seriously doubt the capability of the Gauntlet of House Bjornaer to judge if an apprentice is ready to become a magus. We had a visitor, a certain Bjornaer magus. He was not very pleasant company, acting like our money was his to spend, but that is not what upset me. He stayed for a couple days, seeming to find good company with our other guest, the Magus Ex Miscellanea. Then, he simply left without saying a word. We did not really care - nothing bound him here, we thought he had just moved on.

A while later, though, he returned to the covenant to request absurd sums to construct some buildings, and was oddly unspecific about the whereabouts of his construction site. Being good sodales who honour the traditions of our tribunal, we provided him with some men and a reasonable amount of resources. Vexator volunteered to not follow him (since this would be a breach of the code), but he could not help stumbling upon the site in a routine inspection of the lands our covenant claims. Naturally, we were anything but happy to find him building on our land. So we set out to confront him.

It turned into quite a confrontation indeed. The fool even drew his absurdely long sword, repeatedly stating that it is not meant to compensate for anything, and waving about in the vain hope to intimidate us. He claimed we would be infringing on his property, yet there was no Sanctum Sigil to be seen and the land was ours by the code. The only reason we did not immediately enter the cave was to avoid bloodshed and maybe find a better solution. Or more incriminating evidence, should someone mourn the death of the fool.

Incrimaniting evidence was indeed not hard to find, since the magus had shown the sublety so stereotypical for his house in his pursuits of whatever lay inside the hill. Undine uncovered hints that he had killed the previous lord of the village, usurped a title as their new lord and abducted a local noble daughter. A spell of the Intellego Vim class, cast upon the ruins of the former lord's house, revealed traces of powerful Creo Auram magics. Even worse, there were signs of a failing harvest, with plants dying. In an ad-hoc council meeting, we decided to enter the cave, by force if necessary. Something was amiss, and the actions of that foolish bjornaer constituted more than just interfering with mundanes - a breach of the peripheral code the rhine gorge has a history with.

Force was indeed necessary. The fool blocked our way, attacking Vexator, who had not passed up a single opportunity to antagonize him. His parma proved surprisingly effective, though, and using the strange shapechanging of the Bjornaer, he was able to escape from our spells in bird form, our Sodalis Ex Miscellanea on his tail. Meanwhile, my esteemed colleague Vexator and myself entered the cave, disposing of his minion with a Pilum of Flame spell. What we found confirmed our worst suspicions: rats. It seemed he had stumbled upon an infernal place somehow connected to the infection we cleared out just a short while ago. While Undine used her Aquam magics to clear out the rat holes, our Sodalis Ex Miscellanea finally brought down the Bjornaer, pinning him to the ground.

The wounds of the foolish mage were quite serious, yet first there was a more pressing matter: It seemed he had been tempted to create the whole mess by a daemon. Using magics of the Perdo Vim class, I was able to at least chase it away, though some trace remained. We have bound the Bjornaer's wounds (and him), and are currently preparing to depart for Durenmar, where we will hand him over to the honourable Archmagus Philipus Niger. I have no doubt that will be his end should there be any trace of the infernal left. In the meanwhile, we will have to investigate if there are further ploys of the rat daemon in the vicinity of Nummus Prosper.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2311">[[Günther]] still couldn't believe his master really intended to go along with the promise he had made about half a year ago, but here they were on [[Pfalz Island]], all ready to leave for Italy. And not only on foot - they would not even take Simon along to do all the daily chores. Since his master hat also sworn not to use any magic, Günther had no illusions about on whom those chores would fall when [[Aphanius]] got bored with them after a day or two. Yet he knew the Tremere magus to well to complain or say anything. At least, without magic, he would probably not get any weird ideas about wandering into faerie forests and telling Günther to stand back from all fights.

The faithful shieldgrog smiled at one of the passing grogs. During the last week, they had all placed bets on how long Aphanius would really go without magic, and how far he would be able to carry his own backpack before passing it to Günther. None had believed the magus would make it a week, but Günther was confident he would win his bet that Aphanius would carry it all the way to Rome. He had travelled with the Tremere and knew he was stronger than his slender frame suggested. Aphanius would not tire of the backpack. He would tire of the mundane world, and the day-to-day chores. That seemed to be the real challenge of the pilgrimage.

As the sun reached noon, his master finally appeared, all set for travelling. It seemed Vexator had not been able to resist coming down from his lab to gloat over the humble departure of his former Princeps. Even Günther smiled at seeing the young magus without his sword and typical robe (a replacement for the garment Vexator had cut still hadn't arrived from Coeris), wearing only a white robe, sandals and his backpack. It would be good for the young and harsh magus to learn some humility, though Günther was far to well trained to show any signs of his schadenfreude. Without further hassle, they took the boat over to Kaub and went on their way. They would have to set a hard pace to make it to Rome in time for Easter. The spring equinox was only ten days away, and then it would be a further two weeks to Easter. Still, soon they would meet up with the Via Carolingia, a famous pilgrimage route, which would ease and fasten their journey considerably.
