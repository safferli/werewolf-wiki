Concrete wood is a [spirit court](spirits "wikilink") encompassing the
"bones" of the city: buildings, streets, channels, etc. As in real life
and as the trees in a wood, the court is omnipresent (and quite vital to
the existence of the city's Hisil denisens), but not very active or
powerful. Most spirits are greater Gafflings, but they are totally fixed
on their sorroundings, ignorant to the going-ons outside their houses.

The court seems organised in "neighbourhoods", which encompass all
members in a certain area and are supposed to be able to communicate
(painfully slowly). Most buildings of importance have spirits that leave
this court to join a more active one; therefore there are almost no
Jaggling members.
