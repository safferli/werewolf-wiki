The [Church of our Saviour on the
Blood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Savior_on_Blood) is
one of the most famous churches in Russia. It is build on the spot where
Tsar Aleksandr II of Russia was mortally wounded in an assassination by
anarchists. The Church's architecture is unique in the city, as it was
build in the style of older churches.

The church was long closed to the public, used as a warehouse from 1917
to the mid-60's, when it was dubbed 'Church of our Saviour on Potatoes',
a name still used by less religious citizens. It has since been restored
to its former splendour, and is a major tourist attraction. Religious
services resumed in the 70's, and the crypt is currently renovated. It
houses the remains of Aleksandr II and a number of other important
russian nobles, and is closed to the public.

The pack suspected that the [Red Court](Roter_Hof "wikilink") is somehow
tied to the church, but investigations run into a dead end when they
heard the crypt was completely shut off, the key to the mighty iron
gates resting with the [episcop](Dorofey_Evgenikov "wikilink") of Saint
Petersburg, on old man unwilling to let anyone into the 'unspoiled
sanctum of our mother church'.
