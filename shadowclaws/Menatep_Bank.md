Menatep Saint Petersburg Commercial Bank is one of the leading
investment banks in Saint Petersburg, with an old tradition. It's
foundation reaches back into the 19th century, when it was established
as [Wawelberg Bank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wawelberg). After the
revolution, the bank temporarily moved to Poland, but returned during
Soviet times.

After a crisis in the 1990s, when the bank came under investigation by
the
[FATF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Action_Task_Force_on_Money_Laundering)
for money laundering and financing criminal activities, the bank has
emerged strengthened by the fall of the iron curtain, and is now one of
the primary investors in Saint Petersburg's growing economy, providing
loans for new projects, mergers, and expansions.

The bank is managed by a board of directors with 8 members, one of which
is [Edouard](Edouard "wikilink"), who has the role of [Chief Investment
officer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Investment_Officer).

The headquarters is housed in [Wawelberg Bank
building](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wawelberg_Bank_building), in the
centre of Saint Petersburg, close to the [Church of our Saviour on the
Blood](Church_of_our_Saviour_on_the_Blood "wikilink"). The old building
has a renovated, modern interior, and Edouard's office is on the top
floor. There is a permanent security guard at the entrance, and a
magnetic card is needed for entrance.
