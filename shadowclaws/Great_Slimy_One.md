The 'Great Slimy One' was a lesser Jaggling that manifested in the
sewers due to the biological waste [transported there by some criminal
elements](fight_in_the_sewers "wikilink"). It quickly took over the main
locus in the sewers (situated right on the origin of the contamination),
replacing [Athumu](Athumu "wikilink"), and established its own court. In
the following weeks, the court grew stronger and stronger, until it was
the predominant court throughout most of the sewers.

The [Giftläufer](Giftläufer "wikilink") were a kind of spirit that
provided muscle for his court, and an enemy the pack repeatedly faced.

He was eventually discorporated by the pack and subsequently destroyed
during the [cleansing of its locus](fight_in_the_sewers "wikilink").
