The Night Cafe Petersburg is a club and bar in the northeast of the
packs territory. It is reserved for rich people, and two doormen keep
anyone out who does not fit with the clientele. The bar is infamous
since it is located in a residential area - primarily for workers and
employees - but does not stick to regulations about noise at night. In
fact, it seems it enjoys special protections, as there has not been a
police raid in years, despite neighbours complaining about the noise and
somewhat frequent disappearances of people.

The disappearances are usually explained by young, beautiful people from
the lower stratum of society running away to live as playmates or
something similar. It is well-known that many of the male visitors of
the club "pick up" such beauties to accompany them inside.
