Taras Mihailov is the youngest member of [Crimson
Tears](Crimson_Tears "wikilink"). His first change happened in Moscow,
and rumour has it that law enforcement would very much like him to
return to answer some questions. It seems he gathers most information
for his pack, and is quite good at what he's doing.

He initially intended to join the Storm Lords, but has very recently
failed their trials, thus remaining a Ghost Wolf.

He was killed by [Shuro Koshonin](Shuro_Koshonin "wikilink") after
discovering some kind of secret in the territory of
[Glasfelle](Glasfelle "wikilink").
