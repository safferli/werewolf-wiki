Beneath the [St. Nicholaus
Cathedral](St._Nicholaus_Cathedral "wikilink"), in a number of extensive
cellars, lies an altar that is a [locus](locus "wikilink"). It's
resonance was a very weird (and oddly specific) one, best described by
"sacrifice (of others) for personal gain". [Angus](Angus "wikilink")
performed a rite here to change the resonance, and with the help of
[She-Who-Was-Eternally-Lost](She-Who-Was-Eternally-Lost "wikilink") the
locus now has a resonance more focused on "personal sacrifice",
something very close to the spirit. The strength of the locus is
unknown, as its physical part is off limits currently.
