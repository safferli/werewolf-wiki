A locus is a powerful place where the gauntlet is very thin. As a
result, essence is generated, and crossing between the material and
spirit world is far easier (for many beings, it is only possible at
loci).

Therefore, loci are focus points of supernatural conflict in the world
of werewolf: Spirits and werewolves seek them as power bases, and others
might be drawn here due to their resonance.
