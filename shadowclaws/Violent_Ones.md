The Violent Ones are a court composed of spirits of - how else could it
be - violence and violent feelings. They are quite strong, yet due to
their nature they are not very united. They are very aggressive, and
usually cannot be bargained with. It is not clear if this is the same
court as the [Roter Hof](Roter_Hof "wikilink") or another one. It seems,
though, that the latter is restricted to the area below [Bar
Strocic](Bar_Strocic "wikilink").
