A powerful yet fractured spirit court. It is related to negative
emotions, but not to violent ones - gloom, despair and fear seem to be
most prevalent. It is likely the most powerful court in the pack's
territory, but it has almost no unity - there are some more powerful
spirits in this court who are in fierce competition for followers.
Prominent members include
[She-Who-Was-Eternally-Lost](She-Who-Was-Eternally-Lost "wikilink") and
[Pitch Black](Pitch_Black "wikilink").

Another powerful member was the previous owner of the pack's
[locus](old_radio "wikilink"), but it was destroyed by the pack.
