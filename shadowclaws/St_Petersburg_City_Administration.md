The [Saint Petersburg City
Administration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg_City_Administration)
is not famed for its efficiency. In fact, general opinion in the packs
territory seems to be that they are a bunch of incompetent fools,
wasting tax money - a view reflected by numerous articles in the
[Admiralteyski Wochenblatt](Admiralteyski_Wochenblatt "wikilink").

The Administration is huge, but there are some parts that are important
for the pack:

  - [St Petersburg Sewage and Waste
    Authority](St_Petersburg_Sewage_and_Waste_Authority "wikilink"), the
    employer of Angus, who leads the branch for western Admiralteyski.
  - [St Petersburg Cultural Heritage
    Authority](St_Petersburg_Cultural_Heritage_Authority "wikilink"),
    the employer of Grigori, who currently works as a restauration
    supervisor.
  - [Admiralteyski Police
    Department](Admiralteyski_Police_Department "wikilink"), strictly
    speaking not a part of the city administration but of the [Ministry
    of Internal Affairs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MVD). They work
    together closely and are often perceived as one entity. [Nievo
    Ashkov](Nievo_Ashkov "wikilink") is a senior officer within the
    appartment, responsible for the [pack](Shadowclaws "wikilink")'s
    [territory](territory "wikilink").

[Edouard](Edouard "wikilink") knows some of the more important members
from his work at [Menatep Bank](Menatep_Bank "wikilink"), a bank that
sometimes provides credits for construction projects.
