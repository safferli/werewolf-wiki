A spirit of St. Petersburg, suffering and violence. It embodies the
aspect of the city as a place built on the blood of innocents, a
battlefield, and the centre of an emerging military power. It seems to
have once been allied to the Pure, but since the reconquest of the city
by the Forsaken no werewolf has seen it.
