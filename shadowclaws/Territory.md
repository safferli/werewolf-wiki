#### Overview

The [pack's](Shadowclaws "wikilink") territory is in St. Petersburg, in
the district of Admiralitetsky. It consists mainly of low-income
residential areas and a few larger industrial complexes. The territory
claimed by the pack is marked in red, with the area de facto belonging
to the [Spirits of Fire and Steel](Spirits_of_Fire_and_Steel "wikilink")
marked by a dotted line. [frame](image:Territory.jpg "wikilink")

#### Industrial areas

Industrial areas are coloured red.

[Drnaya Steel Works](Drnaya_Steel_Works "wikilink") and [Asovitch
Rohrbau](Asovitch_Rohrbau "wikilink") are both large heavy-industry
steel works that employ many people in the area. They are both not doing
to well, and Asovitch Rohrbau has recently been hit by conflict with the
mafia when they were involved in a [waste disposal
scandal](fight_in_the_sewers "wikilink"). In the Hisil, they are home to
the [Spirits of Fire and Steel](Spirits_of_Fire_and_Steel "wikilink")
court.

#### Commercial areas

Commercial areas are coloured yellow.

There is a small commercial area in the southwest of the territory,
located between Asovitch Rohrbau and Drnaya Steel Works. The sports club
(<span style="color:red">**I**</span>) where [Grigor](Grigor "wikilink")
and [Angus](Angus "wikilink") give their courses -- 'self-confidence
through self-defence' and 'meditation and yoga for everyone',
respectively -- is located in this area, as well as the administrations
of the two large companies. There is also a
[cinema](Spartak_cinema "wikilink")
(<span style="color:red">**H**</span>) in this region, where Angus and
his new-founded [Cinema club](Cinema_club "wikilink") regularly visit
and a lot of the youths of the area meet.

The [police department](Admiralteyski_Police_Department "wikilink") for
western Admiralteyski is located in the center north. The local head of
police is since more than a decade -- with a brief interlude -- [Nievo
Ashkov](Nievo_Ashkov "wikilink"). The police department is still trying
to recover from the [recent](Fight_in_the_sewers "wikilink")
[events](Battle_against_Rote_Wut "wikilink") and the raid carried out by
Grigor and [Aleksandr](Aleksandr "wikilink") to free
[Ivana](Ivana "wikilink").

#### Residential areas

Residential areas make up by far the majority of the pack's territory
and are coloured blue. The darker the blue, the poorer the area.

In the south and to the west between the factories are run-down areas,
with many shabby and half-destroyed buildings, especially in the west.
Angus lives here (<span style="color:red">**A**</span>; voluntarily,
even). There are some pot plants in front of his home, which he needs to
exchange every few days. A [Locus](Locus "wikilink"), the
[Heimeligkeitsfenster](Heimeligkeitsfenster "wikilink")
(<span style="color:green">**A**</span>), is also located in the
basement of a destroyed building in this area. Next to the river, at the
site of a former theater, is a [garbage-burning
facility](garbage-burning_facility "wikilink") responsible for the bad
air and the lack of rebuilding programs in these parts.

The poor area to the south houses the pack's main
[locus](old_radio "wikilink") (<span style="color:green">**B**</span>)
in the building of the [St Petersburg Sewage and Waste
Authority](St_Petersburg_Sewage_and_Waste_Authority "wikilink"), Angus'
workplace. The area contains [another small
locus](Black_locus "wikilink") (<span style="color:green">**C**</span>)
in a small chapel. This area is home to a poor immigrant community,
mostly Finns and Ukranians.

In the center are low-income houses, mostly belonging to workers in the
two factories or clerks from the factories' administrations. Some also
have their own small shops, mostly in the southwest. The other pack
members, Grigor (<span style="color:red">**B**</span>),
[Edouard](Edouard_Lambert "wikilink")
(<span style="color:red">**C**</span>), [Grigori](Grigori "wikilink")
(<span style="color:red">**G**</span>) and
[Aleksandr](Aleksandr "wikilink") (<span style="color:red">**D**</span>)
live here. The infamous [Bar StroÄ‡ic](Bar_Strocic "wikilink")
(<span style="color:red">**E**</span>) is located in this area, as well
as the largest cinema in the area.

In the east is a [newly acquired](Breeding_Grounds "wikilink")
residential area. Mostly middle-class shop-owners and employees live
here, along with some upper middle-class businessmen. The [St. Nicholaus
Cathedral](St._Nicholaus_Cathedral "wikilink")
(<span style="color:blue">**C**</span>) is in this part of the city, as
is [The Petersburg Night Cafe](The_Petersburg_Night_Cafe "wikilink")
(<span style="color:red">**F**</span>). Under the cathedral is [another
locus](old_altar "wikilink"), but the area sorrounding it is still
swarming with Rahglu and thus very dangerous. There is an ongoing
conflict over property in a large part of the area, where the original
deeds of the houses where lost (and recovered, but not yet published, by
the Shadowclaws). Other problems are crime, especially in the southern
area, and the Night Cafe with its far too late opening hours. The
[Neighbours for Neighbours](Neighbours_for_Neighbours "wikilink")
operate in this area.

#### Famous Landmarks

The only famous landmarks in the pack's territory is the aforementioned
St. Nicholaus Cathedral. It is sorrounded by a small park. Sadly, due to
remains of an infestation by [Rahglu](Rahglu "wikilink"), the park is
everything but safe at night.

Only a short distance from the pack's borders is the [Saint Isaac
Cathedral](Saint_Isaac_Cathedral "wikilink")
(<span style="color:blue">**A**</span>) and the [Bronze
Horseman](Bronze_Horseman "wikilink")
(<span style="color:blue">**B**</span>), a large and very famous statue
of the city's founder, Peter the Great.
