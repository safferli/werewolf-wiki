A bit to the east of the immigrant quarter in the south of Admiralteyski
lies a
[cathedral](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolaus-Marine-Kathedrale),
inside a small park. The park and lower part of the cathedral are open
during daytime, while the upper, more magnificient part is only open
during certain festive days of the orthodox church.

The lock on the upper door was [found
broken](The_fate_of_The_Bleeding_Stone "wikilink") when Grigor pursued a
Ridden here. As the pack informed the authorities, this has probably
been mended by now.

The park's fence is not very high, leading homeless people to sometimes
seek shelter in the park. There has been a series of reported
disappearances of these people, yet noone seems to care enough to
investigate.

After the [death](Breeding_Grounds "wikilink") of one of the workers
here, the entrance to the church and the park had been barred, but
recently both where reopenend to the public.

Beneath the cathedral, behind a brick wall, lie extensive cellars,
former home to a strange breed of [spirit wasps](Rahglu "wikilink").
There is also a [locus](old_altar "wikilink") here, now property of
[She-Who-Was-Eternally-Lost](She-Who-Was-Eternally-Lost "wikilink"). The
cellars have been closed temporarily due to privacy concerns, but are on
the list of places where measurements for the subway constructions have
to be taken.
