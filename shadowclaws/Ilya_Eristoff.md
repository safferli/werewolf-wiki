A young boy of 17 years, he recently underwent his first change. He is
from the [Eristoff](Eristoffs "wikilink") family, a wolfblooded family
used by the Ivory Claws for breeding 'pure' werewolves. As he is now
included into Forsaken society and a member of the [Crimson
Tears](Crimson_Tears "wikilink"), he certainly has an interesting future
before him.

He is on good terms with [Edouard](Edouard "wikilink"), due to the
Cahalith's involvement with his former family; this is one of the few
ties between the [Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink") and the Crimson
Tears and might prove valuable in the future.
