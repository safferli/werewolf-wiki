'Glasfelle' is a pack of werewolves living to the east of the
[Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink"). They are also part of the
[alliance](alliance "wikilink"). This pack is the most 'friendly' of the
neighbours the Shadowclaws have, and especially their Iron Masters
maintain good ties with the players. Shuro has also been of help at
times, though he usually is not very forthcoming with advice, preferring
for the Shadowclaws to solve problems themselves.

The 'Glasfelle' are dominated by Iron Master ideology: They take a very
modern approach to maintaining a territory. Since two of their three
members are also in the [Lodge of Shepherds](Shepherds "wikilink"), they
have very good contact with the humans in their territory. Andrei is the
alpha of the pack (and the leader of the shepherds), though it seems
that most decisions are made by the member first encountering them and
then accepted by the pack.

Other packs watch the modern approach of the Glasfelle with disapproval,
but it appears to be working well. Their territory matches that of most
other packs in size - yet there are only three of them. Shuro seems to
do most of the fighting, and the spirits tell many tales about his
legendary skills in combat. It is noteworthy that no werewolves outside
the pack have seen him fight yet, though.

The pack's totem, called "Ubuntu", is a spirit of community. It helps
the two Shepherds understand the humans in their territory even better,
and seems to enable the pack to communicate over longer
distances.
