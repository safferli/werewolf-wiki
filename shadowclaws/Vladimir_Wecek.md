Vladimir is personally known only to one member of the pack --
[Grigor](Grigor "wikilink"). As the other werewolves regularly state
they prefer it that way, this is not likely to change any time soon.
Vladimir is the mafia contact of Grigor, the one who tells him what his
superiors want and the one to go to if something wrong is going on.
Vladimir and Grigor usually meet in a small restaurant, where the salad
is unusually good. At least, Grigor always only eats salad.

#### Description

Vladimir looks like the common guy on the street -- that might be the
best description of him. Wearing a grey pullover, an old coat and jeans,
it is easy to miss him in the streets even if you know how he looks. His
face has no distinct features except for a stern look.
