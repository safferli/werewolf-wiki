The 'Neighbours for Neighbours' are a neighbourhood watch scheme
initiated via the [Admiralteyski
Wochenblatt](Admiralteyski_Wochenblatt "wikilink"). They form small
groups, who keep watch in an area to the south of the packs territory.
They [interfered](Breeding_Grounds "wikilink") with the pack on some
occasions, but seem to be quite popular among the locals.

They are, or at least were, somehow involved with the
[Eristoffs](Eristoffs "wikilink"). Some of them were slaughtered when
the Pure attacked, but they recovered quickly, and seem to be better
equipped recently. They are currently trying to be recognised as a
charitable organisation, which they achieved [by
now](Media:Zeitung9.pdf "wikilink").

Recently, they gained support rather rapidly, and now there are even a
growing number of policemen who hail the Neighbours for Neighbours as a
helpful initiative to combat crime and corruption.

[Nievo Ashkov](Nievo_Ashkov "wikilink"), Head of Admiralteyski West,
seems to be opposed to the idea. Yet he was heavily wounded and is
currently in hospital, with release not due for another month. In
contrast, [Eris Bobrov](Eris_Bobrov "wikilink"), Head of Admiralteyski
East, was always an outspoken supporter of them.
