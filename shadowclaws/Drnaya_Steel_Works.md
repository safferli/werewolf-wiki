The western part of the pack's territory is occupied by Drnaya Steel
Works. The factory consists of several parts, transforming scrap iron
and raw materials to pipes, beams and other large steel constructs. The
steelworks are one of the biggest employers in the area, and has
considerable security. It is not known if it is involved with the mafia
that runs a lot of the district's business. Work at the factory is
harsh, and the low pay is one of the contributors to the general
feelings of gloom and despair that are prevalent in the area.

Close to the part were the scrap iron is melted, there is also a
[garbage-burning facility](garbage-burning_facility "wikilink").

The Hisil side of the steelworks is in the firm grip of the [court of
fire and steel](Spirits_of_Fire_and_Steel "wikilink").
