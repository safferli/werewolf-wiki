Shadowname: Stählernes Wort (Word-of-Steel). Elodoth and alpha of the
[Litanei der Straßen](Litanei_der_Straßen "wikilink"). Vanya is a member
of the [Enlightened](Enlightened "wikilink") lodge of the Storm Lords.

She is very stern and has a short temper, leading her pack with an iron
fist. She honours the [alliance](alliance "wikilink"), though she always
makes it perfectly clear that any violations of the territory of her
pack will be met with lethal force.

Her pack members seem to hold her in very high regard, which is probably
a consquence of her always leading from the front. She prefers to fight
in Urshul form.
