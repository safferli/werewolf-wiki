Storm Lord Elodoth and alpha of the [Schatten der
Zaren](Schatten_der_Zaren "wikilink"). The oldest Storm Lord in the
city, leader of the [Enlightened](Enlightened "wikilink") lodge and high
judge. He seems proud of his position and commonly described as being
very cool-headed and serious.

Victor looks like he is in his late sixties - for a werewolf, that could
mean his age is anything up to eighty. He is usually wearing a suit,
although nothing too fashionable. On werewolf-only occasions, he usually
carries his two-handed sword with him. The sword is not really burning,
but it reflects light in a very bright, vivid orange forming strange
patterns.
