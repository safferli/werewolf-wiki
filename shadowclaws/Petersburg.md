This page contains a general overview of the setting and important parts
of the saga.

### City

Some information on the city (in case of conflicting statements,
information on this wiki takes precedence): [St.
Petersburg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg)

A map of some of the no-man's-land in the City Center:

"Image:PetersburgTerritory.jpg")

A map showing the territory claimed by Forsaken packs (some things are
different, e.g. the subway stations in the no-mans-land don't exist
yet):

![Image:packs.jpg](packs.jpg "Image:packs.jpg")

The territory claimed by the [Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink") is
the part marked by the red line. The dotted red line shows the territory
of the [Spirits of Fire and
Steel](Spirits_of_Fire_and_Steel "wikilink"), where the player's claim
is only nominal. The area to the north and east is claimed by [Schatten
der Zaren](Schatten_der_Zaren "wikilink") und
[Glasfelle](Glasfelle "wikilink"), respectively. In the south is the
former territory of [Rote Wut](Rote_Wut "wikilink"). Since the pack was
a quite bloodthirsty one, this area should be considered dangerous at
best. The spiritscape is reportedly a huge mess of former allies and
enemies of Rote Wut battling for control. Recently, the last surviving
member of Rote Wut moved in with a [new pack](Crimson_Tears "wikilink"),
but they seem to have a hard time regaining control of the territory.

Most of the closer Terra Incognita appears to be residential and
industrial areas. The area is not claimed by any pack.

Some interesting places in the no-man's-land to the east of the pack's
territory are listed in the [setting](:Category:Setting "wikilink")
category.

The [Admiralteyski Wochenblatt](Admiralteyski_Wochenblatt "wikilink") is
a local newspaper published somewhat irregularly in this part of the
city.

### Territory

The packed carved out a small piece of land in western
[Admiralteysky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiralteysky_District) as
their [territory](territory "wikilink"). The choice was not really
theirs, as an alliance of some packs in the city centre more or less
showed them where a good place for a new pack would be. At least they
provided some initial help. [Aleksandr](Aleksandr "wikilink") grew up in
this part of the city and [Grigor](Grigor "wikilink") had lived there
for a number of years, which probably turned out be more of a problem
than a boon.

### Locus

The pack's main [locus](old_radio "wikilink") is an information locus
located in the newly-established environmental supervisory division of
the [St Petersburg Sewage and Waste
Authority](St_Petersburg_Sewage_and_Waste_Authority "wikilink").
[Angus](Angus "wikilink") works here, so the pack has easy access to the
locus. It is located in the computer of the chief of the unit. Recently,
Angus was promoted acting chief, so the locus is actually in his own
office now.

### Dramatis Personae

Some of the territories inhabitants have regular Dealings with the
werewolves, for various reasons. This is an incomplete list of important
NPC's in the
territory.

### Factions

Besides the various [spirit
courts](:Category:Angus'_Spirit_Almanac "wikilink"), there are currently
four other packs in the area that are known to the
[Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink"), all them are part of a loose
[alliance](alliance "wikilink"):

The pack [Schatten der Zaren](Schatten_der_Zaren "wikilink"), the most
senior pack in the city and the centre of the alliance.

[Glasfelle](Glasfelle "wikilink"), a smaller pack to the far east of the
Shadowclaws. They usually stick to themselves, but have worked as
teachers for the [Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink").

The pack [Litanei der Straßen](Litanei_der_Straßen "wikilink"), a
secretive and disciplined pack to the northeast of the Shadowclaws'
territory.

There was also [Rote Wut](Rote_Wut "wikilink"), a pack of Ghost Wolves
with a kill on sight policy. They were not members of the alliance and
where recently almost extinguished in a
[fight](Battle_against_Rote_Wut "wikilink") with the Shadowclaws.

[Die Amazone](Die_Amazone "wikilink"), the sole survivor of the conflict
with the Shadowclaws, has founded a new pack reclaiming the former
territory of Rote Wut. They run under the name [Crimson
Tears](Crimson_Tears "wikilink").

Almost all werewolves in the area are also part of one of the
[lodges](lodge "wikilink") of their tribe.

### Houserules
