Maucrice was the head of the [St Petersburg Sewage and Waste
Authority](St_Petersburg_Sewage_and_Waste_Authority "wikilink") and
Frenchman. He usually took a hands-off approach to heading the
department, which suited the pack. During the events of the [battle
against Rote Wut](battle_against_Rote_Wut "wikilink"), we was found dead
in the burned-out headquarters. He had a wife, although it is unknown if
she will stay in St Petersburg now - and, frankly, since they lived in a
different part of town, the pack couldn't care less.
