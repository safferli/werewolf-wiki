This is an overview of all important Characters in the Saga. Note that
only inhabitants of the physical world are listed here. For the strange
inhabitants of the Hisil, see [Spirits](Spirits "wikilink").

## Werewolves

There is an [alliance](alliance "wikilink") of Forsaken in the city,
trying to keep internal quarrel to a minimum. It's a very loose society,
mostly held together by the constant threat of the Pure besieging the
City from the east.

### [Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink")

The player's pack.

  - [Aleksandr](Aleksandr "wikilink")
  - [Angus](Angus "wikilink")

### [Litanei der Straßen](Litanei_der_Straßen "wikilink")

alliance but don't expect it to work.

changed a lot [recently](Battle_against_Rote_Wut "wikilink").

  - [Arja Haajanen](Arja_Haajanen "wikilink")
  - [Ilya Eristoff](Ilya_Eristoff "wikilink")

### Unbound

A very rare thing for werewolves, there are still some who do not bind
themselves by pack and territory, instead choosing to wander, spending
their lives travelling. Most of these meet a quick end at the claws of a
more territorially inclined pack, but there are some who have the wits,
resources or usefulness to survive.

  - [Smauri "Forgesoul"
    Ivarrson](Smauri_"Forgesoul"_Ivarrson "wikilink"), although it seems
    he has finally settled down now
  - [Yorek "Howl-from-beyond"](Yorek_"Howl-from-beyond" "wikilink"),
    grandfather of Nadja, relieved from a terrible burden by the pack
  - [Boneblade](Sergei_Grigorovich "wikilink"), former member of Crimson
    Tears, left after a public disupte with Arja; currently it is not
    known where he is
  - Klauenwind, a former Rahu of [Rote Wut](Rote_Wut "wikilink"), lost
    in the Hisil ...

### Other

Werewolves from other packs that live far away from Petersburg not to be
important as a whole.

  - [André Fazegas](André_Fazegas "wikilink"), a werewolf from Spain
    from the lodge of [Lightning](Lightning "wikilink")

### Pure

There are few Pure that the players know by name - most of the fighting
with the Pure occurs to the east of their territory, and usually they
only meet them in battle.

  - [Whitefang](Whitefang "wikilink")

## Friends and Family

Despite their savage nature, the pack has some friends among the human
population.

A family of Wolfblooded living in the pack's territory. Formerly used by
the Ivory Claws for breeding Pure.

friends -- or more.

  - [Nadja Ivanetsch](Nadja_Ivanetsch "wikilink"), Angus' girlfriend
