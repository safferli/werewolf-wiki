Wissendes Auge der Nacht is a stray cat spirit encountered by the pack
during their rite of initiation. After the spirit repeatedly stole
essence from an area the pack was guarding, they tracked it down and
gave it a simple choice: Become our totem or perish.

Wissendes Auge der Nacht does not trust easily - as is reflected in its
ban. The initial relationship with the pack was quite strained, given
the blunders the newly changed werewolves made during their first
dealings with the spirit wild. However, as they worked toward securing
their territory, the spirit became a valuable ally, particularly in
their struggle against the [Great Slimy
One](Great_Slimy_One "wikilink").

The Chorus Numina allows Wissendes Auge der Nacht to call upon other
[cat spirits](Cat_Spirits "wikilink") in the territory.
