    and helping between packs and werewolves

    group combat, be it with their pack or a group of trained humans

    lore of the old days and the great battles fought since the birth of
    the forsaken

    to successfully carry out the Forsaken's duty

    technology as a tool to keep their territories clean
  - [Smiths](Smiths "wikilink"): this lodge encompasses craftsmen of all
