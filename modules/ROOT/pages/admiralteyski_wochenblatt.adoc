= Admiralteyski Wochenblatt

'Admiralteyski Wochenblatt' is a local newspaper in the Admiralteyski
district of St. Petersburg. Published somewhat irregularly (read: as the
GM has time), it is mainly concerned with the going-ons in the pack's
territory, and therefore an important source of information for the
pack. Devoting a large section to 'reader's opinions', the newspaper is
a good measure of the current mood of most humans in the territory - an
essential factor in spirit politics. Below are the editions the player
characters have, with an approximate date of publications.

The Wochenblatt is owned by [Miika Kovalov](Miika_Kovalov "wikilink").
