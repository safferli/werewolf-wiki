"Wakeup, breakfast is ready\!". Edouard slowly woke up as Alena poked
him with the new Admiralteyski Wochenblatt.

"Wow, thanks. I'll be ready in a minute."

Later that breakfast, as Alena read through the newspaper, she said: "Hm
... Neighbors for neighbors have opened their archives to the police. I
wonder what kind of information they have collected. You do realize that
they only have themselves as a supervisor and could be collecting tons
of data without ever deleting it?"

"May be they do, maybe they don't. But I'd really like to know what they
know. It could prove to be useful in the future. What else does it say
about them?"

"Nothing specific," Alena replied. "But there is the same ad that was in
the last newspapers:

"Do you think you can just walk up to them and ask them about their
archives?"

Edouard grinned. "No, definitely not. And I don't have the time nor the
inclination of walking the streets at night."

"You don't?" Alena gave him a surprised look.

"Well, I do what I have to do, and I don't want them to interfere with
my schedule. And I don't want you out there either. That's much too
dangerous. As a non-profit organization they are bound to have some sort
of secretary or bean counter smart ass. I'll volunteer to be his
substitute. And if it fails, I can always donate a chunk of money. My
tax adviser doesn't care as long as it is deductible. Or maybe you want
the job? It would be a pity if you got bored to death."

"Let's go easy on that one," Alena said. "We should first find out if
they actually need that sort of help."

"Fair enough. I'll write them a letter."

Later that day, Edouard prepared the letter:

> Dear fellow citizens,
>
> I have seen your newpaper advertisments in the Admiralteyski
> Wochenblatt and have a few questions about the ways in which I can
> help you. Please give me a call under 0900-545569 so that we can
> further discuss my involvment.
>
> Have a safe day
>
> Edouard Lambert

Two days later, the Lambert's phone rang. "Good Morning Mr. Lambert. I'm
Vlad Azarkh from Neighbours for Neighbours. If you have time at the
moment, I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about our
Neighbours for Neighbours."

"Thank you for calling, Mr. Azarkh, " Edouard replied. "I have heard
much about your work and as a caring Citizen of St. Petersburg I'd like
to invest in the safety of my family. Let's say about five to ten
thousand rubels a year. I'd have to consult with my tax advisor on the
exact amount and it would also depend on how efficient Neighbours for
Neighbours are at securing the safety of the city."

"That is a very generous offer, Mr. Lambert and I can assure you that we
will be putting it to good use. There will be an annual meeting for all
our sponsors and interested citizens where we present our work and
spendings. But let me tell you something. You seem to be interested in
the big picture and development plans that are best discussed in a more
relaxed atmosphere. A few times a year, our leading staff and friends
are having a brunch to talk about more general ideas. You know, things
that aren't decided yet, and topics where we think more work needs to be
done, and such things. If you are interested, I'll put you on our list
so that you get an invitation for the next meeting so that you can meet
the people that handle your donation."

Edouard suppressed a small grin. "My schedule is quite packed and I
really regret that I don't have the time to get personally involved in
Neighbours for Neighbours. But I really appreciate your offer of
transparency. I suggest I will sort out the details of the donation with
my advisor and I am looking forward to you invitation. I guess I will
ask any questions personally at the brunch. Have a nice day."

Edouard hung up the phone and began typing an SMS to Angus: "You'll
never guess who is on the guest list for the brunch with sponsors for
NfN."
