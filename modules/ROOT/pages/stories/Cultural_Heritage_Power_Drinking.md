Grigori is well respected for earning his
[employer](St_Petersburg_Cultural_Heritage_Authority "wikilink") an
almost undisputed first place on the (highly informal) list of power
drinking prowess amongst Europe's ranking Cultural Heritage Authorities
(ever seen a French art history nerd, after half a bottle of vodka?
You'd better have not).

Clearly, it's all cheesy to praise someone for his aptitude in drinking.
The more considerable advantage of creating such an image is that it
gets Grigori some grip on other employees. Whenever there's some need to
talk about things like [archaeological findings on the subway digging
sites](Breeding_Grounds#Act_4:_Know_your_enemy "wikilink"), there's no
need to elaborate a false pretence to talk to the official in charge.
It's widely considered normal that Grigori knocks some colleagues door
(with a bottle of vodka in his hands) and invites himself for a little
chat.
