=== Background

Grigori Timoschenko was born in 1980 in the city of Omsk. His father
held a position as engineer in the Russian defence industry, his mother
was an actress. At the age of about ten, Grigori's family moved to the
town of Jakutsk. This turned out to be a cut in his life. He didn't get
along very well with his new environment and became a kind of loner. He
found great comfort, though, in the Siberian storytelling of his
girlfriend Lena's grandparents. The passion for these stories never left
him and carried him through his studies of civil engineering in Ufa. He
was lucky to find a job where he could have his peace, as head of the
night shift at St Petersburg's lock 17. He gave up this position in
favour of a position close to the pack's locus, though he's probably
less into pack discipline and definitely not into tribe discipline.
Frequently uses the word "fascist".
