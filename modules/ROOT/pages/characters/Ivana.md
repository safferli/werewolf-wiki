'' 'Aleksandr's girlfriend.' ''
\-- Angus on Ivana

Ivana Njatiskova is a long-term friend of
[Aleksandr](Aleksandr "wikilink"). They used to work in the same
company, and have pulled quite a few criminal jobs together. Ivana is
not aware of Aleksandr's change -- lately she had enough problems of her
own, with a police investigation and an arrest warrant against her. She
is currently hiding in the pack's territory, and usually communicates
with Aleksandr via a Britney Spears fanpage. She helped in uncovering
the waste disposal scandal.

### Description

Ivana grew up with computers, and she lives with them. That shows: While
she is not fat (and how would she, given how little she eats), she
certainly isn't the athletic type. Her clothing is usually pragmatic and
not prone to change quickly. She often appears tired -- however, that
might be misleading, she is usually quite aware of what's going on. With
a mere 1.62 meters, she is rather small.
