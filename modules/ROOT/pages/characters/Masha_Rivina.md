When young werewolves in St. Petersburg reverently list the names of
[Schatten der Zaren](Schatten_der_Zaren "wikilink"), 'Sings-the-Stars'
is more often than not left out. The Cahalith of the pack is a dreamer,
renowned among Cahalunim for her accurate visions. It is known that she
is often on long trips through the Hisil, though noone can tell what
exactly she is doing there. She frequently misses meetings of the
[alliance](alliance "wikilink"), so most members of other packs don't
even know what she looks like.
