Sergej Grigorovich, a Rahu of the pack [Crimson
Tears](Crimson_Tears "wikilink"), is only a few month from his first
change. Prior, he served in the russian military - now, that is no
longer an option. Not very talkative, he clearly functions as the muscle
of the pack, and still has a lot to learn about the problems that come
with his newfound power.

His Shadowname, 'Boneblade', stems from a knife made of the bones of his
father, also a werewolf, which he always carries along. His father fell
in a battle against the Pure near Petersburg, about two years ago. The
knife is very likely some sort of fetish, though its powers are unknown.

Sergej has on several occasions shown his contempt for werewolves
outside his pack, in particular the
[Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink"). When [die
Amazone](die_Amazone "wikilink") died to save his life, he [made a
promise](In_memory_of_Amazone "wikilink"): He carved the name of the
Cahalith's killer, [Whitefang](Whitefang "wikilink"), into his right
arm, swearing to not the scar heal before he'd avenged her.

Sergej took up the role of alpha afterwards. Since his feelings towards
non-pack werewolves are no secret, it was assumed that he would break
with the alliance sooner rather than later. For some reason, this has
not happened yet.

After his packmate [Arja Haajanen](Arja_Haajanen "wikilink") decreed in
front of court that [Shuro Koshonin](Shuro_Koshonin "wikilink") was
right to kill their packmate [Taras
Mihailov](Taras_Mihailov "wikilink"), he left without swearing revenge.
He has not been seen since then.
