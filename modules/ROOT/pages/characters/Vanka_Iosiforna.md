Vanka is a Cahalith of the [Glasfelle](Glasfelle "wikilink"), the
youngest of the pack. She has a nice face, but is a bit too short and
'robust' to be really beautiful. She seems to spend a lot of time
travelling around, often outside the territory of the pack.

Vanka is quite reserved, and prefers to listen instead of talking. She
gets along exceptionally well with the lower stratum of society.
