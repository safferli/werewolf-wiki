Dorofey Evgenikov ist the episcop - the orthodox equivalent of a bishop
- of St. Petersburg. He is 92 years old, and quite frail. There is
widespread belief that he is no longer capable of carrying out his
duties, and that the churches in St. Petersburg suffer from neglect and
bad management. Dorofey is usually not seen in public, for health
reasons.

Nominally, Dorofey is still the priest responsible for [Saint Isaac
Cathedral](Saint_Isaac_Cathedral "wikilink"), but due to his failing
health there have not been services at the cathedral since some years.

It is to be expected that, should Dorofey finally die, his replacement
will have some impact on the church in Saint Petersburg - and the most
important churches in the city are located in the area to the east of
the [Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink").
