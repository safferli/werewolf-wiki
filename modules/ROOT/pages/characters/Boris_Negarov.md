Boris Negarov, the Rahu of [Schatten der
Zaren](Schatten_der_Zaren "wikilink"), is almost a legend along St.
Petersburg werewolves, frequently matching [Victor
Flammendes-Schwert](Victor_Flammendes-Schwert "wikilink"). He is quite
willing to give advice to young members of his tribe - but a lot more
hesitant to actually step in and help. He always states the oppinion
that no pack deserves a territory they can't conquer on their own.

Boris is known to have little regard of the
[alliance](alliance "wikilink"), but going along with the designs by his
alpha. He is a solitary werewolf and leads the [Blood
Seekers](Blood_Seekers "wikilink") lodge, dedicated to find a fight that
truly challenges him.

Grigor has sought him out for assistance on occasion. He is also an
accomplished boxer. Boris fights in Urshul form, and is quite likely the
best solitary fighter among the Forsaken of Petersburg and its
surroundings.
