The Rahu of [Litanei der Straßen](Litanei_der_Straßen "wikilink") is a
furtive figure. Unlike most other Full Moons, she seems to disfavour a
direct approach, instead relying on the element of surprise. That being
said, the Cahalunim tell many a tale of how she saved her pack.

'Klang des Asphalts' is little known outside the pack, which is usually
represented by Yelena or Vanya. She seems to be quite at home in the
Hisil, making sure the shadow side of the packs territory stays clean.

She fights with a fetish longsword that she can draw out of nowhere in
the Hisil, a blade she seems quite adapt with. The pack has yet to hear
her speaking a word.
