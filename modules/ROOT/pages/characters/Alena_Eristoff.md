Alena "*[Whitefang](Whitefang "wikilink")'s Daughter*"
[Eristoff](Eristoffs "wikilink") is a quite handsome woman in her early
thirties. She is currently staying with [Edouard](Edouard "wikilink"),
since she has been estranged from her family. It seems they blamed her
for the wrath of the Pure and kept her locked up in her room, regularly
beating her. She is slowly opening (and warming) up to Edouard, where
she stays and spends most of her time. She is still quite hesitant to
leave the flat and the protection of the pack, but has started helping
[Lana Yakisovna](Lana_Yakisovna "wikilink") in the [Café
Alexanderplatz](Café_Alexanderplatz "wikilink").
