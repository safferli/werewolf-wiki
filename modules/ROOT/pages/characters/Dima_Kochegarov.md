Dima Kochegarov is a Cahalith of the pack [Litanei der
Straßen](Litanei_der_Straßen "wikilink"). He is quite old, apparently
past his fourties. [Angus](Angus "wikilink") is the only packmember to
consider him more than a fleeting acquaintance, and describes him as a
kind spirit, who willingly parts with the wisdom of his age, if asked
properly. He seems to function somewhat as a lorekeeper of the
[Enlightened](Enlightened "wikilink") lodge.

Dima carries a staff which seems to have the same effects as a spear on
spirits, shattering their shadowbodies on impact.
