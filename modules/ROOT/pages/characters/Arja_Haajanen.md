Arja is the physically oldest member of the [Crimson
Tears](Crimson_Tears "wikilink"), a reserved woman with a somewhat
unhealthy interest in the deceased. She is a mystic, spending many hours
contemplating. The Crimson Tears pay her great respect for her wisdom,
though it seems they are a bit afraid of what is actually going on
inside her.

She previously belonged to another pack, but little else is known.

Arja Haajanen owes the [Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink") one
unspecified favour, a duty taken over from [die
Amazone](die_Amazone "wikilink") upon her death.

Arja has shown that she lacks a bit of touch with reality, perhaps being
to obsessed with her study of the mystic and the balance of spirits,
ghosts and mortals. Practical thinking seems to be one of her weak
points.
