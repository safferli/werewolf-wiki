A small, slender woman in her late twenties. She is rather shy and
unobtrusive, preferring to hang back and listen. She used to work at a
flower shop but now runs the [Café
Alexanderplatz](Café_Alexanderplatz "wikilink") with the help of the
[Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink"). Her sudden change of work leaves
her a bit stranded, but it seems she really enjoys taking over the café
that her parents had run.

She might have a thing for [Grigor](Grigor "wikilink"), leaving him red
roses on his motorcycle.
