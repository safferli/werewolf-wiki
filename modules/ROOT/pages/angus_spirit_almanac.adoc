= Angus' Spirit Almanach


A collection of the spirit-world knowledge of [Angus
Swims-under-Ice](Angus "wikilink"). Certainly incomplete and subject to
constant change, as usual for the spirit world. An overview is provided
on the [Spirits](Spirits "wikilink") page.

Note: Opposed to other parts on this wiki, some (perhaps even most) of
the articles in this category are character-knowledge and may be
inaccurate or even plain wrong.

This is an overview of spirits and their courts in the territory of the
[Shadowclaws](Shadowclaws "wikilink") and its vicinity. Due to the
nature of spirits, this is necessarily incomplete and partially wrong.
Its still nice to have it all on one page.

Here is a table of the known courts and some very general (and, again,
probably wrong) properties. Spirits are fielded under their court, if
known. Unaligned Spirits or those whose allegiance is unknown are in a
list below the table.

Further down on this page is information on the politics between the
courts, which is mostly speculation by the werewolves.

**Spirits with unknow affiliation**

  - [Athumu](Athumu "wikilink") - probably destroyed by the Great Slimy
    One.
  - [Cinema Spirit](Cinema_Spirit "wikilink") - has helped the pack
    twice, but seems to be largely solitary. Probably heads a small
    court. Probably not.
  - [Daemonium](Daemonium "wikilink") - a very powerful spirit
    representing negativ aspects of the cities history and present. Only
    [Angus](Angus "wikilink") has heard about it.
  - [Window-to-the-West](Window-to-the-West "wikilink") - another very
    powerful spirit of St. Petersburg. Patron of the
    [Enlightened](Enlightened "wikilink") lodge. Largely unknown.
  - [The Son and the Nephew](The_Son_and_the_Nephew "wikilink") - a
    court? two courts? two weird spirits ... what will become of them
    now?

**Politics**

  - Internal Strife in Grey Court.
  - Court of Eternal Grace on good terms with Urban Ronins.
  - [The High Court of
    Petersburg](The_High_Court_of_Petersburg "wikilink") - who is a
    member, how far reaches its power?
  - Network/Information/Order: possibly alied.
  - Handmaidens of Bloodshed: For hire to highest bidder.
